                <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Community Biology Biosafety Handbook. The handbook is an open manual that offers biosafety protocols, practices, and recommendations aimed specifically for the community biology movement.</p>
<p>The goal here is to establish a shared foundation for biosafety and security practices for the Community Biology labs. We recognize that while many labs have already developed their practices, other labs are only now coming online and need not reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>The entries on this site are meant to serve both older, more well-established labs, younger labs, and those who are considering building new lab spaces. For well-established labs, the information here can serve as a reference or template for updating safety and security practices. For newer labs or those seeking to build labs, the information can serve as a foundation for establishing biosafety and security practices. Our expectation is that you&#39;ll adapt the material you find here and make it your own.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve tried to make the information accessible, deep, and expansive. Therefore, we&#39;ve tried to make the language as clear and as jargon-free as possible. We&#39;ve also attempted as best as possible to cover the breadth of safety practices in community labs. This includes biological, chemical, and equipment safety, but also subjects unique to community labs. As such, you&#39;ll also find interview practices for screening potential lab members, considerations when working with children at festivals, building tips for creating labs in unconventional spaces, and much more.</p>
<p>We did our best to consider the variety of shapes and sizes of labs. This handbook includes advice for independent labs, labs housed within larger makerspaces, and labs within homes and garages. We&#39;ve also considered the great variety of activities and projects taking place within labs.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-foundation">Creating a Foundation</h2>
<p>This handbook is designed as a living document that can be updated and expanded by the community. Because both biotechnology and the Community Biology movement are rapidly evolving, the information here will need to be updated periodically. Also, given the variety of labs, the diverse local and national laws and regulations around labs, and the variety of interests among lab members, there will always be more that can be covered.</p>
<p>We chose an open format for the handbook so that members of the community can edit, update, and expand the contents. It will be the community&#39;s decision on how best to maintain this handbook.</p>
<h2 id="the-authors">The Authors</h2>
<p>The authors of the handbook are people who have dedicated a significant portion of their careers to the community lab movement. In many ways, this has been a dream team of authors. Five of the seven authors have started or led community labs. One author was president of the American Biological Safety Association, the leading association of biosafety officers. Another author has been a policy expert on community biology for over 10 years.</p>
<p>We would like to acknowledge the time, effort, and energy they put towards making this handbook a reality. Thank you Angela Armendariz, Patrik D&#39;haeseleer, David Gillum, Daniel Grushkin, Eric Harness, Todd Kuiken, and Jenny Molloy.</p>
