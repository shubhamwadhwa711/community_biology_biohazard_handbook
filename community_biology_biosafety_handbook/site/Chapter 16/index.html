                <h1 id="biosecurity-in-community-labs">Biosecurity in Community Labs</h1>
<p>This section discusses management practices to improve biological security, or biosecurity, in community labs. The <a href="https://www.uab.cat/doc/CWA15793_2011">CEN Workshop Agreement 15793</a> defines biosecurity as &quot;the protection, control and accountability of biological agents and toxins&quot; and is designed to &quot;prevent their loss, theft, misuse, diversion of, unauthorized access, or intentional unauthorized release.&quot;</p>
<p>The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) International, defines biosecurity as &quot;the risk-and threat-based control measures established to prevent unauthorized access, misuse, loss, theft, diversion and intentional release of valuable biological materials, pathogens, toxins, information, expertise, equipment, technology and intellectual property that have the potential to cause harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, public safety or national security.&quot;</p>
<p>Because community labs are designed to be open and collaborative, have valuable equipment and sometimes have hazardous materials, they may be vulnerable to individuals who may misuse the space, steal, or compromise valuable equipment, supplies, and information. Every community lab should consider implementing procedures that minimize the risks associated with someone entering the space for this purpose. At the same time, the openness and visibility that community labs offer provides protection against these types of nefarious actors (e.g., if everyone can see what you&#39;re doing, it&#39;s difficult to do something nefarious without someone noticing and stopping them).</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-safety-and-security-policy">Creating a Safety and Security Policy</h2>
<p>Community labs are encouraged to create a Safety and Security plan with members working in the community lab to discuss appropriate methodologies for protecting valuable biological materials (including pathogens and toxins), equipment, expertise, and intellectual property. Many community labs already have safety contacts, but we recommend considering adding security as part of their mandates, or designating another point of contact.</p>
<p>A good first step to improving biosecurity is to implement modifications to practices that don&#39;t change ease and accessibility but mitigate potential risks. To some degree, these include small changes to lab procedures. On a larger level they include membership education and promoting awareness and understanding.</p>
<p>We recommend drafting a Safety and Security plan that includes policies about signage, labels, training, supervision, work hours, and codes of conduct. Examples of such plans can be found <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/ohse/assets/docs/biosecurityplan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.labmanager.com/lab-health-and-safety/2011/11/the-4-key-parts-of-a-biosecurity-plan#.Xc1z0S2ZPOQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>Information about the safety contact or team and their responsibilities should be shared broadly within the organization. Biological security responsibilities include the following, which may overlap with other responsibilities such as emergency planning, lab management, and members training:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain knowledge of applicable <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4661789/">biosecurity rules, standards, regulations, and guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>Understand and communicate membership vetting procedures.</li>
<li>Consider biosecurity risks in the risk assessment.</li>
<li>Recommend strategies for the detection of thefts, losses, and containment breaches of lab materials (e.g., observing spilled containers, Petri dishes in improper places, lab materials in trash receptacles).</li>
<li>Include security elements in safety induction training such as how to identify and remove unauthorized individuals from the lab (e.g., contacting police or security services).</li>
<li>Develop training elements that address how to protect valuable biological material and sensitive information (e.g., good data management practices, information accountability, computer, and network security).</li>
<li>Ensure a system is in place to account for all biological/chemical materials and related information in the facility (e.g., biological, chemical, and equipment inventories).</li>
<li>Prepare for possible emergencies (e.g., fires, earthquakes, flooding, building damage, gas leaks, power outage) and perform drills to test emergency response procedures.</li>
<li>Plan ahead on how to handle news media inquiries.</li>
<li>Create a strategic protocol if a suspicious package arrives at the community lab.</li>
<li>Establish good relationships and ask for help with training from local fire, police, emergency response, and public health institutions.</li>
<li>Evaluate the lab&#39;s safety and security plan regularly to make recommendations for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biological-inventory">Biological Inventory</h2>
<p>Biological inventories are needed in community labs to effectively assess the risks of the materials being used. Most community labs should have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/edit">risk assessment</a> process in place for biological materials coming into the lab, which usually occurs at the start of a project and is periodically reviewed. Having an on-going biological inventory helps with this process and gives individuals beyond the lab management the opportunity to view what is being used. Inventories are also beneficial to keep track of materials as most community labs encourage the sharing of resources.</p>
<p>Community labs should consider an inventory system for all biological organisms and molecules (including synthetic nucleic acids and plasmids), diagnostic specimens, human and animal blood and sera, and other potentially hazardous biological materials (if they exist in the lab). Examples of items to record in a biological inventory should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of material (e.g., the genus and species)</li>
<li>Date of addition, as well as expiration date (if applicable)</li>
<li>Type of container (e.g., a Petri dish, conical tube, lyophilized sample)</li>
<li>Location information (e.g., building name, room number, freezer number, location in freezer)</li>
<li>Name of responsible party and contact information for emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Inventories should be maintained for freezers, refrigerators, dewars, and other containers used to store biological materials. The community labs should also consider implementing a regular inventory sweep or spot check system to verify that all materials are present and accounted for, and dispose of anything past its expiration date.</p>
<p>A copy of the biological inventory should ideally be provided to local public health departments and emergency response teams on a frequent, regular basis (if appropriate for the jurisdiction). Importantly, the inventory should be available in the event of an emergency in both digital and paper form.</p>
<h2 id="chemical-inventories">Chemical Inventories</h2>
<p>An inventory of chemicals, along with <a href="https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html">safety data sheets</a> and other information about the chemicals being used, is vital to ensure compliance with federal, state, and municipal regulations (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYqzPyAHi27CkCsik3r6f58RzkLGFy2NTFG9N7vEd1E/edit">Chapter 10 - Chemical Safety</a>). Community lab volunteers and members cannot adequately prepare for fires or emergencies without this information, so it protects them and the surrounding community. A well-managed inventory system also promotes sustainable operations, such as an economical use of chemicals (i.e., the time and expense of procuring new chemicals may be avoided if it is already in the inventory), and promotes shared resources. Responsibility for chemical safety may be a specific role or assigned to an existing member of the lab&#39;s Safety Team.</p>
<p>The key elements of any chemical inventory should include the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of chemical</li>
<li>Molecular formula</li>
<li>Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number (CAS #)</li>
<li>Fire rating for the chemical</li>
<li>Source of the chemicals</li>
<li>Volume of the container</li>
<li>Quantity of chemicals</li>
<li>Date of acquisition and/or expiration date (to ensure that unstable chemicals are not stored beyond expiration)</li>
<li>Any safety-related documentation for the chemical (link to the SDS for digital inventories) <a href="https://www.msdsonline.com/sds-search/">Click here</a> for a link to many SDS sheets.</li>
<li>Location information (e.g., building name, room number, cabinet, shelf)</li>
<li>Name of responsible party and contact information for emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to monitor the inventory is equally important. This would ideally be accomplished by the use of a chemical inventory log to track when a chemical is used or leaves the lab for any reason along with an annual stock-taking. Key elements of a log would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date and name of person adding chemical to inventory</li>
<li>Name of person removing the chemical from inventory</li>
<li>Name of chemical being removed from inventory</li>
<li>Date chemical removed from inventory</li>
<li>Amount used (if applicable)</li>
<li>Name of person returning the chemical to the inventory</li>
<li>Date chemical returned to inventory</li>
</ul>
<p>A copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tp3xQsqfTVTN-jGD9aiUQBdoXZcmTmOIXGWwwO8E5Fo/edit?usp=sharing">chemical inventory</a> should be provided to local fire departments and emergency response teams on a frequent, regular basis if this is appropriate in your context. Importantly, the inventory should be available in the event of an emergency in both digital and paper form (see <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/ehs/documents/ls-chemical-inventory-template.xls">example</a>).</p>
<h2 id="equipment-inventory">Equipment Inventory</h2>
<p>The equipment and devices used in community labs are often costly and difficult to obtain, yet essential for successful community and member projects as well as workshops and other learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Having an accurate list of equipment and devices in the space is helpful in the event of theft or damage, including from fire or other catastrophic events. Law enforcement and insurance companies may request the inventory to prove that the device or equipment originated from the community lab. Implementing a log to record usage may also be useful for scheduling maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p>Pieces of equipment and devices used in the community lab may be used to cause harm. For example, centrifuges, fermenters, incubators, and other devices could be used to create illegal or illicit products, such as drugs or explosive devices. Other equipment, such as laptops and microscope lenses are prone to theft because they can be easily pocketed and resold. Be aware that this is a possibility and monitor this equipment carefully. If there is any suspicion of theft or misuse, labs may wish to install video monitoring for critical equipment, install anti-theft cables or access locks, or move the equipment and devices to a less visible or locked location.</p>
<p>Managing an accurate list of the equipment and devices, along with their serial numbers, in the facility will allow for better security and reduce the risk of a possible nefarious act. While there is a hope that everyone entering the community labs is altruistic and good natured, there may also be individuals with other intentions.</p>
<h2 id="vetting-new-members-and-guests">Vetting New Members and Guests</h2>
<p>A community lab works because of the unity and purpose of community members. While projects should be vetted for chemicals, methods, organisms, and ethics, it is important to also vet the individuals, groups, and guests of the lab. Because of the close-knit nature of a community lab, one bad apple can ruin the collaborative nature of the space.</p>
<p>Labs should consider implementing a process to evaluate individuals wishing to gain access to the facility. This may be accomplished through an application form, which outlines the roles and responsibilities of everyone using the facility, codes of conduct, and terms and conditions of lab membership. Assessments—including interviews and reference checks—may be used to decide whether an individual would make a suitable member of the lab.</p>
<p>Here is a list of methods others have used to vet members of their community lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite them to open houses, classes, social events, or meetings and see how they interact.</li>
<li>Observe how individuals respond to requests for cleanup, adhere to safety policies, and treat shared equipment.</li>
<li>Ask them to do group tasks to see how they interact with others.</li>
<li>Ask about their ongoing progress and challenges to get to know them better.</li>
<li>Create a trial period during which the new member has more restricted access to the lab and existing members can block their membership.</li>
<li>Require current members to vouch for a new member.</li>
<li>Look at a person&#39;s social media and public reputation to determine intent and character for approval (usually only done when there&#39;s a reason to suspect an issue with a prospective member).</li>
<li>If the member is working with kids, or protected individuals, you may also be required by law or insurance to pay for a professional background check.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, procedures to remove an individual from the premises and the organization should be established and be clearly communicated to individuals using the facility. Everyone in the community lab must be expected to conduct experiments in a safe and ethical manner, and follow all federal, state, and local laws.</p>
<p>We recommend monitoring individuals who exhibit unusual behavior, make other members feel uncomfortable, are closed or become secretive when you approach them about their work, or are aggressive or combative with others during interactions.</p>
<p>Vetting is an ongoing process even after members have joined and there may be issues that arise that may cause a lab to deny membership or ban a current member. Individuals working in a community lab should report significant changes in behavior, attitudes, demeanor, or actions (e.g., increasingly withdrawn, significant, and prolonged deterioration in appearance, unjustified anger or aggression, signs of alcohol/drug abuse, criminal activity, and unexplained absences) to the lab management or the Safety and Security Team.</p>
<p>Other scenarios that should be reported to the Safety and Security Team include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stated or implied threats, whether written or verbal, to individuals or the organization.</li>
<li>Any circumstances that appear suspicious, such as activities that do not correspond to stated official project goals, requests for security or facility information without justification, acts of vandalism or property damage, and attempts to gain unauthorized access for friends or colleagues.</li>
<li>Unlawfully carrying weapons or carrying weapons in violation of facility policies.</li>
<li>Bringing in, growing, or synthesizing unapproved or illegal substances.</li>
<li>Providing false information on applications or other formal institutional documents.</li>
<li>Unauthorized work performed by an individual(s) in a facility during off-hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code of conduct agreements, membership agreements, waivers, and other documents should set standards for behavior and dismissal. It is important to have open lines of communication with new members so that should an issue arise, there are no surprises regarding disciplinary action.</p>
<p>| <strong>Real-world Experiences with Problem Members</strong>
&quot;We had a member in the lab who was an outspoken advocate for community science, and who seemed to mesh well with the community members. However, we were alarmed that social media portrayed this individual in a different light. Very aggressive posts, attacks on communities, science validity, discouraging, profanity-laced comments, quickly informed us it violated our code of conduct and membership agreement, and that we did not want this person as part of our community. We informed a network of labs of our findings and now have a reciprocal permanent ban on this member in the community. &quot;
&quot;We refused one new member, because he made several of the women in the space feel uncomfortable. There was no single instance of behavior that would have gotten an existing member banned from the space, but since he was still in his trial period, it was easy enough to say, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, but we don&#39;t think you would be a good fit for our community&#39;.&quot;
&quot;One guest attended many networking events with the community over a month. This member, like many, wanted more skills and knowledge from more advanced scientists. At first, they were shy and soft spoken. Then they began aggressively asking and cornering people to teach them. This progressed into visiting at times when the lab was closed to the public and blasting staff with profanity when they were asked to leave. Later we learned about them calling their drug dealer from a staff member&#39;s phone.&quot; |

<h2 id="resolving-conflict">Resolving Conflict</h2>
<p>When dealing with problematic members, it is best to attempt to <a href="https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/provide-information-enhance-skills/conflict-resolution/main">resolve conflict</a> early or as soon as possible before the problem exacerbates. Investigate, be curious, ask questions, try to understand what the member&#39;s intentions are. It&#39;s sometimes possible that a member is not self-aware enough to know that they are causing problems.</p>
<p>Invite the member to meet with the lab manager or leadership, and explain clearly what the issues are. Make sure to be specific about the changes that need to be made. If feasible, offer the member an opportunity to improve their behavior in the lab, and conduct frequent check-ins and closely monitor their activities.</p>
<p>If there are problems between members, be sure to bring the members together to discuss the problems openly. Don&#39;t take sides, but rather get the members to hear and understand each other and come to an agreement together on how to resolve the problem. In severe cases, there may be professional mediation services you can call upon within your community.</p>

<h2 id="removing-members-banned-list"><strong>Removing Members / Banned List</strong></h2>
<p>Removing members is often a very difficult but sometimes a necessary part of running a community organization. It is important to set standards for conduct and also demonstrate to the community that leadership is willing to hold members to account for their conduct inside as well as outside of the lab. It is important to set up and understand the process of removing and banning a member. These procedures should be documented in your Code of Conduct, Membership Agreement, and possibly other places like your waiver and bylaws depending on your legal structure. Removal could include immediate dismissal during a class, imposing a temporary cool-off period, or a permanent ban from the community lab. These policies should be documented in your code of conduct and adhered to.</p>
<p>One recommendation that should be strongly enforced is to document these cases from many points of view in an incident report form. These documents may be legally required (e.g., by corporate structure) or be involved in legal proceedings. Lab leadership should seek to resolve these issues thoroughly and quickly.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that labs share banned members lists with other community labs and makerspaces, especially in communities where traveling to other labs or makerspaces is possible. Please be aware that there are privacy issues with listing people&#39;s names publicly. Listing of banned individuals should not be shared with the greater public.</p>
<h2 id="lab-access-keys-and-fobs">Lab Access, Keys, and Fobs</h2>
<p>While community labs should be welcoming places, they also require limits to access for the safety and security of staff and members, equipment, materials, and space. Although access policies differ across labs, we recommend these general rules about restricting access to the lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keys and codes should only be provided to people who have been assessed and approved by lab management.</li>
<li>We recommend using keycards or key fobs that allow lab management to track lab entry. This is useful in the case of emergencies, thefts, unauthorized entries, or accidents.</li>
<li>Be sure to keep a log of keys signed in and out.</li>
<li>If an assigned key is lost, or not returned by an old member, be sure to have the key card or fob deactivated.</li>
<li>Consider using locks and keys to restrict containers of hazardous chemicals, organisms, or higher containment facilities (e.g., BSL-2) to only those who have approved access.</li>
<li>Establish clear guest lab access policies. Because guests are often unvetted, some labs restrict guest visits to staff working hours. Others have clear policies of restricting unaccompanied guests.</li>
<li>Consider having a sign-in/sign-out policy for guests.</li>
<li>Establish clear policies about who may enter the lab after work hours. Some labs allow members 24-hour access. Some selectively allow 24-hour access for specific people or activities, while others allow access during designated working hours only. Each policy comes with tradeoffs and should be discussed with membership before being implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protecting-user-information-and-intellectual-property">Protecting User Information and Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The data collected about members often includes personal information, like emergency contacts, health information, or other information that might be sensitive and members might not want openly shared. If you have this information on paper forms be sure to store the forms in cabinets that can be locked. Or if you store the information electronically, make sure the files are password protected and only accessible to authorized personnel.</p>
<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>Some lab members might be working on projects that they intend to patent or keep as private intellectual property. Most community labs choose not to claim any ownership of intellectual property (IP) and expect that the same openness is reciprocated.</p>
<p>All members should be able to provide enough information about their projects to the lab&#39;s Safety Team to conduct a safety assessment. Because they are working in a community lab where open sharing is part of the culture, the members should be informed that they are responsible for protecting their own IP if needed.</p>
