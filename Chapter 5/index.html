<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We recommend developing an emergency plan for different scenarios that might occur at your lab. These might include injuries, fires, chemical or biological spills, equipment failures, and natural disasters. The success of your plan depends on everybody knowing the plan, reacting quickly to an incident and putting the plan into action. The emergency plan, as well as the roles and responsibilities, should be communicated clearly to all members and users of the lab. Sample plans can be found from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1inP4DSocdOEsYaajojMCa6Mk8_OVhfQPAjcoKV1rIck/edit">Biomakespace</a>.</p>
<p>Emergency arrangements should be proportionate to risk of harm and based on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/">risk assessment</a> for the experiments being performed. Online resources are available for incident response and forms used by first responders using the <a href="https://training.fema.gov/icsresource/icsforms.aspx">ICS system</a> in the U.S.. Local fire and safety organizations also provide great resources for creating emergency plans.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-contact-details">Emergency Contact Details</h2>
<p>Because contacting emergency services and the lab management is so important in the case of an emergency, instructions and contact details should be prominently displayed in the lab (e.g., on the back of every lab door) so that anyone could find them. Below are some communication tips in case of an emergency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a list (or rotating list) of designated people who could be contacted in an emergency. Keep in mind which individuals are likely to respond by phone, have key expertise, and/or live close to the lab.</li>
<li>Set up a cascade system. Several telephone companies offer services where a single number can contact multiple numbers at once or an ordered sequence of numbers until someone picks up (e.g., Google Voice).</li>
<li>If your community lab has poor mobile reception, provide an emergency landline or Voice of Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-emergency-plan-documents">General Emergency Plan Documents</h2>
<p>A step-by-step emergency plan should be provided for all members covering a range of scenarios. Step one should always be looking after your own safety first—assess the situation and make it as safe if possible. If it is not possible, then evacuate while alerting others.</p>
<p>The evacuation plan should include a method of raising the alarm, routes to evacuate the building, and where to assemble. This section describes the procedures for dealing with different kinds of incidents that could happen at a community lab.</p>
<p>Emergency plans should also include information on what first responders need during an emergency. These materials may include: maps of the building layout with information relevant to first responders; location<a href="https://www.epa.gov/epcra/final-rule-extremely-hazardous-substance-list-and-threshold-planning-quantities-emergency">of chemicals including Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS)</a>; locations of shut-offs for electrical or water; high pressure shut off locations; and larger area maps which include locations of schools or gathering locations.</p>
<p><em>Agencies that usually require information with the types of information they might require:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>City Hall</strong> : Business operations information, emergency contact</li>
<li><strong>Police</strong> : Alarm information, emergency contacts</li>
<li><strong>Fire Department</strong> : Chemical inventory with amounts and hazard class (usually, a format is provided), inspection for Fire safety, emergency contacts, maps of location and layout (this includes locations of shutoffs and chemicals)</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Health and Safety Department</strong> : Chemical inventory (similar or same as Fire Department); they may also require an inventory of organisms and signage indicating biological organisms or hazards are located; maps of the facility</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="emergency-equipment-and-kits">Emergency Equipment and Kits</h2>
<p>The following equipment may be necessary for emergencies. All lab members should know their locations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency eyewash station(s)</li>
<li>First aid kit(s)</li>
<li>Fire extinguisher(s)</li>
<li>Fire blanket(s)</li>
<li>Chemical spill kit (see details in Chemical Spill section below)</li>
<li>Biological spill kit (see details in Biological Spill section below)</li>
<li>Emergency shower (only required if lab is using corrosive chemicals that may cause injury)</li>
<li>Emergency landline phone (if mobile signal is not available)</li>
<li>Flashlights for use in power outages</li>
<li>Circuit breaker box</li>
<li>Water and or gas shut offs</li>
<li>Incident report forms (examples from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing">Genspace</a> and <a href="https://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/assets/ICS%20Forms//ICS%20Form%20209,%20Incident%20Status%20Summary%20(v3).pdf">FEMA</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fire-safety-emergency-plan">Fire Safety Emergency Plan</h2>
<p>One of the most important emergency procedures is knowing what to do in the event of a fire or explosion. While rare, these incidents can lead to loss of life and destruction of the lab.</p>
<h3 id="fire-procedures">Fire Procedures</h3>
<p>Document the fire procedure in the event of discovering a fire and hearing a fire alarm. Ensure copies of the evacuation procedure are visible in the lab and that your safety training includes a full walk through, including location of fire alarm switches, extinguishers, fire exits, how to open them, and where assembly points are located. An example of an emergency plan is shown below. An example training guide is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BsAFCwetBTr3i8s3aznZpigcwLzubyCQk8yVQDf4MTc/edit">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="RackMultipart20210327-4-4qldl1_html_be904bcf747104f3.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Example of a fire safety emergency plan.</p>
<p><strong>Fire Procedure Training</strong></p>
<p>All lab members need to be capable of sounding the alarm and evacuating themselves from the building, and the safety training provided should cover this. They should be instructed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarize themselves with the fire procedures and escape routes.</li>
<li>Report to the Safety Team any concerns regarding fire safety.</li>
<li>Ensure that fire doors are not held open by fire extinguishers or wedges and that fire exits are not blocked.</li>
<li>Comply with all site rules, including not smoking in or around the building as applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lab users should be advised to make their experiments safe before evacuating wherever possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning off all flames and other ignition sources.</li>
<li>Closing all hazardous material containers.</li>
<li>Closing the sashes on all fume hoods.</li>
</ul>
<p>A case-by-case risk assessment and alternative fire evacuation procedure will need to be undertaken for members and visitors who have disabilities that might impact their safe evacuation.</p>
<p>Fire Extinguishers</p>
<p>Different fire hazards require different fire containment measures. For example, electrical fires are best tackled with carbon dioxide (CO2)–based fire extinguishers and should not be approached with water-based fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>Show people the location of the fire extinguishers and ensure they are aware of which one should be used for which type of fire. In the U.S., there are Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.157">requirements</a> for employers to inform employees about fire extinguisher usage. It is important to stress that they should only attempt to extinguish a fire if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is safe to do so.</li>
<li>They are comfortable that they know what they are doing.</li>
<li>It is a small fire that could feasibly be extinguished.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are organizations that offer fire safety courses, including extinguisher training, that members could attend. We recommend contacting your local fire service to ask about training opportunities for your safety team and other members. Local universities may also have fire marshall courses that you could join.</p>
<p>When purchasing fire extinguishers for the lab, check with local regulations and insurers if they have specific requirements. Remember that most extinguishers require inspections and servicing on an annual basis.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Fires and Explosions</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="RackMultipart20210327-4-4qldl1_html_b914bca9c971079.png" /></p>
<p>In case of chemical fires or labs where explosions are possible (e.g., with compressed gases or any explosive chemicals), an emergency plan should include how firefighters can be made aware of these hazards. Information should be available both online and in written form for members to provide to the emergency services. Rooms containing compressed gases should usually have a sign on the door like the one to the left. Check local signage regulations for the exact design.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-first-aid">Emergency First Aid</h2>
<p>Basic first aid kits should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandaids</li>
<li>Adhesive Tape</li>
<li>Instant cold packs</li>
<li>Gauze</li>
<li>
<p>Antibiotic ointment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antiseptic solution or towelettes</p>
</li>
<li>Tweezers or forceps</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Gloves</li>
</ul>
<p>For a longer list of possible first aid kit supplies, see <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-kits/basics/art-20056673">here</a>. In addition, in the U.S., OSHA provides an example of what to include in <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.266AppA">first aid kits</a>.</p>
<p>Most accidents will only be minor in nature (e.g., a paper cut or accidental fall). However, serious injuries or illnesses can occur. To ensure that a first aid emergency is dealt with appropriately, ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>First aid kits are available and their locations are clearly marked.</li>
<li>Location information and emergency numbers are clearly displayed in each room so members can contact the emergency services and instruct them how to access the lab (e.g., which entrance to the building they should use).</li>
<li>All members should know how to contact first responders.</li>
<li>All members should know how to report accidents. We recommend having a standard form to report accidents (see example from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing">Genspace</a>).</li>

<h2 id="chemical-spills">Chemical Spills</h2>
<p>If handled well, a chemical spill may be nothing more than a nuisance. However, if not treated properly, they can also seriously disrupt lab activities, injure people, and damage property.</p>
<p>It is important to have an emergency plan that addresses different types and sizes of chemical spills. In most cases, small spills can be cleaned up safely by the person who caused the spill, since they are likely to be the most familiar with the chemical and its hazards. (Note that even simple water spills should be wiped up promptly, because the next person in the lab may not know it is harmless and may wind up wasting a lot of their time dealing with a water puddle.) However, some spills may require outside assistance, such as if the spill is large or hazardous. Here is a sample<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/guide-for-chemical-spill-response.html">guide for chemical spills</a>.</p>
<h3 id="understand-the-hazards-in-the-lab">Understand the Hazards in the Lab</h3>
<p>Review Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) for the chemicals being used. They will explain the recommended spill cleanup methods and materials, and the required personal protective equipment. The following hazards are of most concern for chemicals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flammability</li>
<li>Reactivity to air or water</li>
<li>Corrosion</li>
<li>High toxicity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="developing-a-chemical-spill-response-plan">Developing a Chemical Spill Response Plan</h3>
<p>The details of a spill plan depend on the chemicals being handled, the quantities, and the risk of a spill occurring. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://ehs.princeton.edu/chemical/spill/procedures">sample plan</a> from Princeton as a resource.</p>
<p>A spill response plan should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names and telephone numbers of individuals to be contacted in the event of a spill.</li>
<li>Evacuation plans for the room or building if necessary.</li>
<li>Written instructions for using the spill kits to contain a chemical spill, including release to the environment considerations (e.g., protect floor drains).</li>
<li>An inventory of the spill kits and personal protection equipment (PPE) so that they can be checked after use and on a periodic basis.</li>
<li>Documentation of how lab members should dispose of the chemical and contaminated spill kit materials, tools, and clothing.</li>
<li>Written instructions for decontamination of the area following the cleanup.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include the spill response plans in safety training for all lab members.</p>
<h3 id="make-spill-control-material-accessible">Make Spill Control Material Accessible</h3>
<p>Most spill control materials are relatively inexpensive. These include items like brushes, scoops, and waste containers that would be needed during the procedure. See Box 1 for <a href="https://ehs.princeton.edu/chemical/spill/procedures#Inventory">example contents of a chemical spill kit</a> that you can adapt to the needs of your lab. A variety of commercial spill kits are available from lab safety suppliers, but read the details carefully; some are &quot;universal,&quot; while others are for specific types of chemicals (e.g., acid absorbing or neutralizing).</p>
<p>| <strong>Box 1:</strong> <a href="https://ehs.princeton.edu/chemical/spill/procedures#Inventory"><strong>Example Contents of a Chemical Spill Kit</strong></a>

</ul>
<p>Make sure the spill kit is readily accessible in a marked location that all lab members are aware of and can easily reach.</p>
<p>Once the plan is in place, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members know what to do in the event of a chemical spill.</li>
<li>Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are easily accessible, ideally both on paper in the lab and online.</li>
<li>Spill kits are easily accessible and members know where to find them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sample-spill-response-plan">Sample Spill Response Plan</h3>
<p>The following procedures are generic and should be adapted to each community lab and based on the relevant risk assessments. In general, responsibility for clean-up rests with the person who caused the spill unless they are injured or unable to do so. Any lab members handling chemicals should have appropriate PPE and a spill kit readily accessible as explained in the section above.</p>
<p>| <strong>Box 2. Example Emergency Plan for Chemical Spills</strong>
<strong>Step 1.</strong> Alert other lab occupants and evacuate the room if necessary. If a volatile, flammable material is spilled, immediately warn everyone, control sources of ignition, and ventilate the area.
<strong>Step 2.</strong> Provide emergency first aid to any injured people. Ensure that contaminated clothing is removed immediately, where necessary cutting clothing away with first aid scissors rather than pulling it over the face or other uncontaminated areas of the body. Many lab accidents have resulted in preventable severe burns where people were too reluctant to remove the contaminated clothing or put it back on afterwards. Flush the area with water under an emergency shower or with another cold or tepid running water source for at least 20 minutes. All those assisting must wear appropriate PPE with a minimum of eye protection, lab coat, and suitable gloves. Contaminated clothing and PPE will usually need to be discarded as hazardous waste.
<strong>Step 3</strong>. Assess the extent of the accident and its seriousness. Refer to safety data sheets for additional information. Determine if it is possible to contain the spill. This will depend on a variety of factors including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amount spilled</li>
<li>Hazardous characteristics of the spilled chemical(s)</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Proper method for cleaning up the spill (see <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d21Y1GKdQOCveWHRxN33DnCbW2KnILwB">Spill cleanup information</a>)</li>
<li>PPE available</li>
<li>Training of the lab&#39;s personnel</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed guidance on assessing chemical spills see the <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/guide-for-chemical-spill-response.html">ACS Guide for Chemical Spill Response Planning in Laboratories</a>.
<strong>Step 4.</strong> Stop the spill or accident from worsening if safe to do so using absorbent materials from the spill kit. After the chemicals have been absorbed, use brush and scoop to place materials in an appropriate container such as a polyethylene bags or buckets for larger quantities.
<strong>Step 5.</strong> After cleaning up the spill, a simple report should be prepared to document what happened, why, what was done, and what was learned. This documentation should be shared with the safety team and other lab users where appropriate to avoid similar instances in the future. According to ACS guidance, major incidents are almost always preceded by numerous near misses.
In case of a large spill, a spill of reactive or hazardous chemicals or a serious accident, do not attempt to clean up. Call emergency services or other responders that are able to deal with the spill. Many waste management companies provide an emergency spill response service. |
| --- |</p>
<p>It&#39;s always better to prevent a spill before it happens rather than clean it up, so we recommend a series of steps to lower the risk of spills. The following more detailed steps are also recommended by <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/governance/committees/chemicalsafety/publications/guide-for-chemical-spill-response.html">ACS Guide for Chemical Spill Response Planning in Laboratories</a>.</p>
<h3 id="assessing-the-spill">Assessing the Spill</h3>
<p>The following chart will help determine the appropriate response in the event of a liquid spill of a substance that is hazardous to health. However, it should not be taken as absolute as some substances will be considerably more toxic, reactive, or flammable than others, and a spill of a chemical in one location may represent a higher risk than the same type of spill in another location.Therefore, each spill must be judged accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="further-considerations-for-dealing-with-a-spill">Further Considerations for Dealing with a Spill</h3>
<p>Following a spill, it is recommended to document the incident as thoroughly and as soon as possible. Everyone involved should review the incident to identify what went wrong and possible steps to take to prevent it in the future. Often, a recurrence may be prevented or mitigated by using smaller quantities, using more robust containers, using secondary containment, using alternative apparatus, or by revised manual handling procedures.</p>
<p><strong>1. Prevent the spread of dusts and vapors.</strong> If the substance is volatile, flammable, or can produce airborne dusts, close the lab door and increase internal ventilation (e.g., through turning on and raising the sash on fume hoods) to prevent the spread of dust and vapors. Be mindful that increased airflow may also cause spread of dusts so plan carefully, e.g., if internal doors are opened, consider the direction of airflow and the potential consequences of the vapor spreading through the building. Any spill requiring the use of respirators and face masks should be escalated to a professional company or to emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>2. Neutralize acids and bases, if possible.</strong> Spills of most liquid acids or bases, once neutralized, can be mopped up and rinsed down the drain. However, care must be taken because neutralization is often a vigorous, exothermic reaction that can cause splashes and yield heat. For acids, they can be neutralized with soda ash or sodium bicarbonate. Bases can be neutralized with citric acid or ascorbic acid. pH paper can be used to determine if neutralization has been successful.</p>
<p><strong>3. Control the spread of the liquid.</strong> Contain the spill by using spill pillows or piles of absorbent materials around the outside of the spill but not touching the chemicals (yet). If a spill or leak is within an unopened or intact parcel, consider if the parcel be safely moved outside to a suitable place away from drains before dealing with it. Secondary containment should be used during transit to avoid contaminating the building.</p>
<p><strong>4. Absorb the liquid.</strong> Absorbent materials can include commercial absorbent pads, pillows and granules, or cheap materials such as cat litter or vermiculite which work well but are messy. Loose spill control granules should be distributed in a circular motion working from the outside to the inside over the entire spill area to reduce the risk of splashing. If using absorbent mats, work from the outside toward the center, carefully laying the mat onto the spill to avoid splashing or spreading the spill. Large mats can be cut to size. For larger spills, protect floor and rainwater drains by placing spill socks and absorbent materials around them.</p>
<p><strong>5. Collect and contain the cleanup residues.</strong> Neutralized residue or absorbent material should be scooped, swept, or placed into a screw-top plastic bucket or other container. For dry powders or where the liquids have completely absorbed, double bag the residual waste using plastic bags and put these in another container (e.g., screw-top bucket) as required for safe transport to a hazardous waste store). For spills of powders or solid materials, consider dust suppressant (e.g., water in a spray bottle). Make sure to clearly label each container.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dispose of the wastes.</strong> Keep cleanup materials separate from normal waste. Ideally, provide hazardous waste bags and buckets with the chemical spill kit. Polyethylene bags may be used for small spills but always double bag. Polythene buckets or bins with clip-on lids are more appropriate for larger spills if chemically compatible with the spilled material. Label the waste container or bag and identifying the material as spill debris with the chemical name and absorbent name. Remember the use of a non-neutralizing absorbent does not alter the chemical properties of the chemical. Store the spill debris until collected by a hazardous waste contractor.</p>
<p><strong>7. Decontaminate the area and affected equipment.</strong> Ventilating the spill area once the spill is removed by opening windows or using a fan. For most spills, conventional cleaning products applied with a mop or sponge will provide adequate decontamination. For questions about the suitability of a decontaminating agent, seek expert advice. Notify the lab management and safety team of the situation and to replenish the supplies of absorbents and other items used in the clean-up.</p>
<h2 id="biological-spills">Biological Spills</h2>
<p>The other type of spill which may be classified as an emergency is of microbiological material, particularly if it is genetically modified or pathogenic. The degree of risk produced by a pathogenic spill depends on the volume and concentration spilled, the route of transmission and the severity of disease hazard produced by the organism. In most community lab settings, which operate at Biosafety Level (BSL)-1, the risk to health and the environment of any organisms in the lab should be low.</p>
<p>Below is a generic procedure for dealing with biological spills in a community lab setting. If a project is using BSL-2 organisms in large volumes, the risk assessment should consider alternative emergency plans, including the need for face protection, an apron, and disposable shoe covers. It may also be advisable to wear a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered respirator instead of a surgical mask. This should be decided in the risk assessment for the organism and would need to be face-fitted to users who would undergo specialist training in its use.</p>
<h3 id="bleach">Bleach</h3>
<p>The most common disinfectant in the world is sodium hypochlorite and there are a few important considerations for using this chemical solution. Bleach is a broad-spectrum disinfectant used against many biohazards. It is fast-acting and widely available at a low cost. Household bleach contains 5.25 to 6.15 percent sodium hypochlorite, or 52,500–61,500 ppm available chlorine. Diluted bleach solutions, such as 10 percent bleach in water, rapidly break down and quickly lose effectiveness. Shelf life of concentrated, undiluted bleach is one year when stored at room temperature, so always store bleach containers in cool, dark conditions to protect from sunlight. Undiluted bleach liberates a toxic gas when exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Always check the sodium hypochlorite concentration on the label to verify if bleach is effective for the material to be disinfected because different organisms have different requirements. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 ppm of chlorine will kill ≥99.9% of Bacillus atrophaeus spores within five minutes.</li>
<li>100 ppm of free chlorine inactivates 106 to 107 <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, S_almonella choleraesuis_, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> in less than 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Higher concentrations of 1,000 ppm or more of chlorine are required to kill <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.</li>
<li>Low concentrations of 25 to 500 ppm of chlorine are effective against mycoplasma and vegetative bacteria.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always prepare bleach solutions on the day needed and discard after use. For a 1:10 dilution, or 10 percent solution, mix one part bleach in nine parts water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work in a well-ventilated area.</li>
<li>Wear PPE consisting of a lab coat, eye protection, and gloves.</li>
<li>Use cold water to prevent chemical decomposition.</li>
<li>Label and date solution with preparation date and initials and discard after use.</li>
<li>Remove PPE including gloves and wash hands thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bleach solutions are classified as an irritant and a corrosive. Chlorine solutions should never be mixed or stored with cleaning products containing ammonia, ammonium chloride, or phosphoric acid. Always know where the nearest eyewash station and emergency shower are located when working with bleach and review the Safety Data Sheet (SDS).</p>
<p>Avoid touching the eyes and skin when working with bleach. Contact with bleach solutions can cause eye or mucous membrane irritation and burns. If bleach gets into the eyes, immediately rinse with water for at least 15 minutes. If skin comes in contact with bleach, rinse with lukewarm water for at least 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Contact with chlorine gases from bleach can cause nausea, eye irritation, tearing, headache, and shortness of breath. If ingested or inhaled, move to fresh air and seek medical attention immediately. When exposure to bleach or any hazardous materials occurs in the lab, notify the principal investigator and consider consulting with a medical professional.</p>
<h3 id="biological-spill-kit">Biological Spill Kit</h3>
<p>Labs should have a biological spill kit prepared and maintained for use at any time. Basic equipment for a spill kit includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentrated disinfectant (this should be appropriate for the microbes used in the lab and be within its expiry date)</li>
<li>Container for mixing up disinfectant</li>
<li>Paper towels or absorbent pads</li>
<li>PPE such as gloves and any other that is determined by the risk assessment for organisms used in the lab (e.g., respiratory protection)</li>
<li>Biohazard and autoclave bags</li>
<li>Forceps or tongs to pick up sharps, broken glass</li>
<li>A small brush or scraper and dustpan to pick up powder and wetted absorbent materials</li>
<li>Signage to prevent people entering the lab</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dealing-with-exposure">Dealing with Exposure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Alert other lab members of the spill and avoid them entering the area. If the spill is infected with a BSL-2 agent, post signage on all lab entry doors to keep people from entering the spill area and allow aerosols to disperse for at least 30 minutes before re-entering the lab.</li>
<li>If you or another member are exposed to the spillage, immediately remove contaminated clothing and other protective equipment and place in a biohazard bag for autoclaving.</li>
<li>Wash contaminated skin with soap and water. Dispose of water and paper towels in biological waste.</li>
<li>If medical follow-up is warranted it should be sought immediately.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cleaning-up-low-risk-spills">Cleaning Up Low-Risk Spills</h3>
<h3 id="general-spills-on-benchtops-or-floor">General Spills on Benchtops or Floor</h3>
<p>Where practical, the person who made the spill should clean up and decontaminate the area. Follow the steps for cleaning up a benchtop or floor spill:</p>
<ol>
<li>Put on a lab coat, gloves and eye protection.</li>
<li>Collect the relevant spill kit.</li>
<li>Place absorbent material around spillage to contain liquid and pour or sprinkle disinfectant around the spill from outside to inside.</li>
<li>Leave disinfectant for the length of time recommended by the manufacturer (for more details on contact times for disinfectants, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8">Working with Microbes)</a>.</li>
<li>Scrape disinfectant powder into a dustpan or soak up liquid using paper towels or other absorbent material. Place in a waste bag for disposal. Note that some disinfectants (e.g., Virkon) cannot be autoclaved as they produce toxic gases when heated.</li>
<li>If there is broken glass it should be picked up by disposable forceps or a plastic scoop and disposed of in a sharps box.</li>
<li>Wash and disinfect the area again with disinfectant according to manufacturer&#39;s instructions (for more details see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gavZZEyT3en6gdKVRByraGLoqybI4nn_zp8g3iSB4w/edit#heading=h.rgnt67nndic8">Working with Microbes)</a>.</li>
<li>Clean and leave the area to dry.</li>
<li>Ensure that all material ends up in the correct waste disposal route (sharps bin, biohazard bag).</li>
<li>Decontaminate used equipment and materials, e.g., scraper and dustpan, with disinfectant before washing and reuse.</li>
<li>Inform Safety Team of the incident and complete an accident report to document what happened, why and what was done, and what was learned.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important:Never dispose of materials that contain living organisms or genetically modified organisms via sink or drains unless it has been deactivated first (e.g., through the use of bleach or other disinfectant).</p>
<h3 id="spills-inside-a-biological-safety-cabinet">Spills Inside a Biological Safety Cabinet</h3>
<ol>
<li>Keep the cabinet running.</li>
<li>Soak up the spill with absorbent material and flood the tray of the cabinet with disinfectant.</li>
<li>Remove any contaminated PPE (e.g., lab coat) and isolate in a biohazard bag to be autoclaved. Put on clean PPE, including lab coat, gloves, and eye protection.</li>
<li>Leave the disinfectant for the recommended time then collect and dispose of the absorbent material through the biological waste stream.</li>
<li>If material has spilled into the catch basin beneath the work surface:</li>
<li>Wipe down any items within the cabinet with disinfectant and remove them.</li>
<li>Close the drain valve and wash the tray, drain, and catch basin with disinfectant, allowing it to soak for the time recommended by the manufacturer.</li>
<li>Lift out tray and remove exhaust grille work for cleaning all surfaces (top and bottom) with a disinfectant solution.</li>
<li>Replace the tray and grill and dispose of disinfectant solution by draining into a collection vessel or absorbing if the volume is small enough.</li>
<li>Thoroughly clean the safety cabinet with disinfectant, making sure to wipe down back and side walls of cabinet.</li>
<li>After completion of cleaning, allow the air blower in the cabinet to run for at least ten minutes before resuming work.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="spills-inside-a-centrifuge">Spills Inside a Centrifuge</h3>
<ol>
<li>Shut centrifuge off and do not open the lid for 20 minutes to allow aerosols to settle.</li>
<li>Put on PPE including lab coat and eye protection. If working with a BSL-2 organism the risk assessment might indicate a respirator mask.</li>
<li>Use a squeeze bottle to apply disinfectant to all contaminated surfaces within the chamber, taking care to minimize splashing.</li>
<li>Allow a contact period equivalent to the manufacturer&#39;s recommendation and then complete clean-up of the chamber.</li>
<li>Remove buckets and rotors to disinfect and clean as per manufacturer&#39;s instructions.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bodily-fluid-spills-and-clinical-waste">Bodily Fluid Spills and Clinical Waste</h3>
<p>The following procedure applies to human bodily fluids or materials such as blood, urine, vomit, saliva, or feces. Primary human tissues and fluids are not typically permitted in community labs which operate at BSL-1, but such a spill may occur due to lab user illness or injury.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alert lab members of hazard.</li>
<li>Any splashes of blood or bodily fluid on the skin should be washed off immediately with soap and water.</li>
<li>Put on PPE, including lab coat, gloves, eye protection.</li>
<li>If there is broken glass, this should be picked up by disposable forceps or a plastic scoop and disposed of in a sharps bin.</li>
<li>Cover blood spillage with absorbent material, or if not available, disposable paper towels or cloths and apply disinfectant. <em>Mops should not be used to clear up bodily fluids because of the risk of cross contamination</em>.</li>
<li>Leave for 3 minutes, then clean up the contaminated paper towels or cloths and place them in the disposal/biohazard bag.</li>
<li>Thoroughly wash the area with detergent and hot water and dry.</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect dustpan and brush.</li>
<li>When cleaning feces, vomit, or urine follow the same guidance and if possible, scoop up excess fluid and dispose of down the toilet. The area can then be washed with hot water and detergent and thoroughly dried.</li>
<li>Inform the Safety Team of the incident and fill in an accident report form (see example from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17spZyvrnOUTjhvRu1T0Boib4EvmaSVXCGK6mYKV1MPA/edit?usp=sharing">Genspace</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="unidentified-spill">Unidentified Spill</h3>
<p>If a spill is unidentified follow the most stringent procedure based on organisms and chemicals that are known to be present in the lab and the circumstances surrounding the spill, including its appearance, smell, and other clues. Investigate promptly what the spill might be to take further appropriate action.</p>
<h2 id="other-lab-emergencies">Other Lab Emergencies</h2>
<p>It is worthwhile considering other situations that might arise in a community lab that might be classified as an emergency (i.e., without rapid action there is a high likelihood of injury or damage). A useful exercise might be to compile a risk register of the events that would be most damaging to the lab, even if they are unlikely. Keep a copy of all emergency response plans in a common, easy to find place in the lab.</p>
<h3 id="-20c-or-80c-freezer-emergency">-20°C or -80°C Freezer Emergency</h3>
<p>Procedures for freezer failures should be posted on the freezer itself so that users can alert the lab management and initiate the backup plan to ensure samples and reagents are saved. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who to contact, including telephone number and email.</li>
<li>What action to take immediately, e.g., do not open the freezer to avoid further heating, switch on the generator.</li>
<li>Where to purchase dry ice if applicable.</li>
<li>Where to find coolers, if applicable, or alternative storage spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a backup freezer or an arrangement with another lab to use one of their freezers in an emergency is recommended. Freezer users should ideally be immediately contacted through a mailing list, text message, or other mechanism. Any delay in repairing the issue or finding alternative freezer space may damage the materials and some users may prefer to make their own arrangements for backup freezer space (and should be encouraged to do so).</p>
<p>Dry ice is useful to buy time in the event of a power outage or freezer failure. Dry ice sublimates at -78.5 <strong>°</strong> C, so it can be used to keep even a -80 <strong>°</strong> C freezer cold for a significant amount of time.It is possible in many places to obtain dry ice on a next day delivery service, and in the U.S. it is available in some supermarkets or gas stations.</p>
<h3 id="major-equipment-failure">Major Equipment Failure</h3>
<p>Autoclaves and centrifuges can undergo catastrophic failures, which at best damage the equipment but have the potential to cause damage to surrounding equipment and the fabric of the lab. Members should know who to call in the event of such a failure, the damage can then be assessed and insurers contacted if necessary (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_62XVMOQJvDlss0J06o-bYTQryuc_3vHL9pxWRSqr0/edit?usp=sharing">Chapter 9 - Equipment Usage/Safety</a>). If the centrifuge failed and contained hazardous biological materials (see the <a href="#_1h2utrbbk0a6">Spills Inside a Centrifuge</a> section).</p>
<p>In case of electrical failure (e.g., a piece of equipment is sparking or emitting smoke), unplug the equipment from the outlet if it is safe to do so (keep in mind that the power cord may be very hot!) or switch off the circuit at the breaker panel (you should have labeled all breakers for this specific reason!).</p>
<h3 id="natural-disasters-and-other-major-incidents">Natural Disasters and Other Major Incidents</h3>
<p>Natural disasters and major incidents will largely be covered by general emergency and evacuation procedures. However, consider having agreements in place with other labs to rescue any salvageable materials from storage, fridges, and freezers in the event of a catastrophic emergency and to enable projects to continue. Be familiar with your organization&#39;s insurance policy and what is or is not covered. You will need to determine the time you can expect to wait for a payout and make arrangements to keep operating if possible.</p>
<p>If any animals are kept in the lab, consider what would happen to them in the event of a major emergency.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-communications">Emergency Communications</h2>
<h3 id="before-the-emergency">Before the Emergency</h3>
<p>Every emergency is different. However, a standard set of resources and tools should be developed that will be useful to have in many situations. In addition to a step-by-step emergency communications plan for first responders and lab management, the following <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/national_emergency_communications_plan.pdf">information</a> would be useful to have before an emergency occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of internal contacts (e.g., members)</li>
<li>List of external contacts (e.g., media, government agencies)</li>
<li>An emergency contact directory (see sample below)</li>

<li>It may be helpful to have templates for press releases and web announcements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="during-the-emergency">During the Emergency</h3>
<p>The following information might be needed during the emergency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incident report form that has been started</li>
<li>Information relevant to the nature of the emergency: maps, chemical inventory, shut offs</li>
<li>Confirmed location of all lab users</li>
<li>Updated status reports on the incident</li>
<li>List of people contacted by the designated media contact</li>
<li>Notes on actions taken and resources needed and obtained</li>
<li>A live narrative to responders of the incident would be very helpful for handovers: what happened what was done, the results, and the outcomes</li>
<li>Any changes to the emergency response and communication (e.g., spill that changed to a fire)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-the-emergency">After the Emergency</h3>
<p>After the emergency has ended, account for all lab members and other people involved in the incident. Document all actions taken and otherwise close out the incident, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation that all lab members and users are safe.</li>
<li>Final status reports on the incident, including what happened, what was done, the results, and lessons learned.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="media-communications">Media Communications</h3>
<p>While the safety of the lab and its members is the priority for an emergency plan, if an incident occurs that could have public and media interest (e.g., a breach of GM containment or a serious lab accident), there should also be a plan in place for dealing with internal and external communication. This should be handled by a member of the lab management team to avoid distracting too much effort and attention away from the larger task at hand.</p>
<p>It is recommended thatall members know what to do if approached by the media and where to direct the enquiry.</p>
<p>An emergency communications plan should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have buy-in from lab management and members. Review the communication plan with the lab leadership and members to ensure that everyone is onboard with the plan. Avoid confused, unclear messages that could result in unfavorable media coverage, negative public relations, and possibly cause legal problems.</li>
<li>Designate a single media contact. Instruct those who are contacted by the media to channel all requests to the designated person media contact.</li>
<li>The designated media contact should focus on providing relevant information in a proactive and timely manner. Tell the truth about the situation, and rapidly resolve incorrect information or rumors. Avoid confused, unclear messages that could result in unfavorable media coverage, negative public relations, and possibly cause legal problems.</li>
<li>Ensure that materials such as press release forms and lists of contacts are up to date.</li>
<li>Be flexible. A basic plan template and supporting document files should be sufficient for managing most emergency situations.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reporting-and-debrief-after-emergencies">Reporting and Debrief After Emergencies</h2>
<h3 id="internal">Internal</h3>
<p>Lab management and any relevant committees or teams (e.g., Directors, Safety Team), should debrief as soon as possible after an emergency. Lab users involved in the incident should also be given a chance to discuss and debrief and reflect on anything that could prevent the incident in the future. If injury or serious damage has occurred, consider the mental well-being of the members as well as more practical debriefs.</p>
<h3 id="external">External</h3>
<p>In addition to proactive internal communication, maintain communications with building or facilities managers and landlords where applicable as well as local authorities if they are involved in the incident (e.g., fire department, public health).</p>
<p>In some cases, reporting to local or national authorities will be required by regulation. Check if the incident is reportable and to whom. Breach of containment of GM organisms will always be reportable in Europe and may be under some circumstances in the U.S. (including to the local Environmental Health &amp; Safety officer, possibly EPA or USDA, and any federal funding agencies). Check local laws and include this in the emergency plan.</p>
<p>You may also need to report events to your insurer if there has been damage to property or if a claim will be received under public or employee liability insurance. The more documentation and contemporary information (e.g., photos and other evidence) the better so following an emergency communication plan will be beneficial for this process.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Security issues that are in progress, such as unauthorized personnel on the premises, unsecured windows and entrances, or a crime that is being or has recently been committed (e.g., a burglary) should typically be dealt with by contacting the police and then the lab management. If the issue is not an emergency but could become a more serious problem, e.g., unsecured windows or doors, then the lab management should be contacted to address the problem as soon as possible if the member who discovered it is unable to deal with it themselves.</p>
<p>If there are additional security resources that can be accessed by members in an emergency (e.g., if the lab is hosted by a university or other organization with their own security guards), ensure that members know of these services and their contact details are included in your emergency contact lists.</p>
