We recognize that while many labs have already developed their practices, other labs are only now coming online and need not reinvent the wheel. The entries on this site are meant to serve both older, more well-established labs, younger labs, and those who are considering building new lab spaces. For well-established labs, the information here can serve as a reference or template for updating safety and security practices. For newer labs or those seeking to build labs, the information can serve as a foundation for establishing biosafety and security practices. Our expectation is that you'll adapt the material you find here and make it your own. We've tried to make the information accessible, deep, and expansive. Therefore, we've tried to make the language as clear and as jargon-free as possible. We've also attempted as best as possible to cover the breadth of safety practices in community labs. This includes biological, chemical, and equipment safety, but also subjects unique to community labs. As such, you'll also find interview practices for screening potential lab members, considerations when working with children at festivals, building tips for creating labs in unconventional spaces, and much more. We did our best to consider the variety of shapes and sizes of labs. This handbook includes advice for independent labs, labs housed within larger makerspaces, and labs within homes and garages. We've also considered the great variety of activities and projects taking place within labs. Creating a Foundation This handbook is designed as a living document that can be updated and expanded by the community. Because both biotechnology and the Community Biology movement are rapidly evolving, the information here will need to be updated periodically. Also, given the variety of labs, the diverse local and national laws and regulations around labs, and the variety of interests among lab members, there will always be more that can be covered.

Structures can depend on your type of space\u2014whether it's a rented space, kitchen lab, space within a larger institution, or a mobile lab. Some labs have a hierarchical structure with a single director, while others have a flat management scheme where there are multiple directors. What seems to be common and good practice across organizations is that there is at least one point person who screens projects for safety (e.g., biological, physical, and chemical) and a committee of people to assist that point person in making decisions about safety and security. Often this committee is internal and allows for multiple people with different areas of expertise to assess and weigh-in on a proposed project. Some labs have several point people, where each is devoted to different safety aspects of the lab\u2014for example, one person might vet chemical safety, while another vets biological safety. Typically, the safety officer(s) of the lab have experience working with chemical and/or biological agents in a research setting, but this is not always the case. One generally recommended practice is to recruit expert advisors outside of the organization who you can consult when the safety of a project is in question or is beyond the expertise of the internal safety point person or committee. These consultants can be safety officers at universities, safety committees at other community biology labs, or colleagues in biotech or university labs who might be an expert in a field related to a proposed project. Many biosafety professionals are willing to help provide advice, serve as resources, and volunteer as a member of a biosafety advisory committee. To find consultants, reach out to Biosafety Officers (BSOs) at your local universities or connect with biosafety professionals through the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) and ABSA regional affiliates . You can also ask biosafety questions on ABSA's Biosafety Discussion List . Negotiating a Lab in a Shared Space Often labs are within universities, makerspaces, or share a building with other businesses or organizations. If the community lab is in a shared space, it is a good idea to initiate and maintain frequent communication with other users of the shared space. Consider holding an open house or inviting neighbors into the space to share experiences and work progress. Tours and open events could be tied to a local Science Festival or event to get maximum publicity. Often these can defuse fears about community labs, make people feel welcome, and help neighbors understand the value of community labs. If the lab does suffer an incident, receives bad press, or is attacked by local officials or interest groups, it can be very valuable to have already built support within the larger community. In a shared space, it is also important to be mindful of common spaces. Lab coats or gloves should not be worn outside the lab. Perception that you are operating safely is important so it may be useful to clearly separate and bag trash that looks like it has come from the lab, even when putting it in the regular waste is permitted by local laws and biosafety rules. This will help prevent other users of the space from getting needlessly alarmed by seeing gloves or other lab waste in the regular bins. Process for Proposing Projects and Vetting We recommend having in-person conversations with lab members (or potential members) about project proposals as a first step in collecting information to address potential safety concerns. Instituting a system where members can formally submit a written project proposal is an important next step. Many labs use an online form to submit project ideas so they may be easily reviewed and approved (see examples of forms from BioCurious , Genspace , or iGEM's safety check ). In the project form, members are often asked to describe the techniques they will use, the chemicals and biological agents they will need, and the amount of time they expect the project to take. Some labs also inquire about the skill level of the person conducting the research to determine whether they might need additional knowledge- or skills-based training or to be matched with a mentor (see Biomakespace's project form as an example). It is a good idea to require long-term members to resubmit project proposal forms when their projects change. Community labs are founded on the belief that experience should not be a barrier to lab access. However, it is always a good idea to assess the experience level of potential members to provide the best possible support to ensure the safety of everyone working in the lab. Depending on skill level, restrictions may be established regarding working alone or operating particular types of equipment until proficiency is gained. Some labs require or encourage less experienced members to enroll in one of the skills building courses offered at the lab. Also, it is suggested to develop approaches for \"On the spot\" training for resources when members seem to lack proficiency. In addition to the project proposal form, some labs ask members to fill out a Risk Assessment Form that is reviewed by the safety team. The Risk Assessment Form helps members think through the potential hazards of their project and to plan mitigation strategies. In some countries, for example the UK, the regulations for any experiments with genetically modified organisms require written risk assessments to humans and to the environment for which \"competent advice\" (as described in the UK Genetically Modified Organisms Contained Use Regulations 2014 ) is obtained before the experiment can start. Labs such as Biomakespace in the UK, therefore, also have a form that is specific for any GM work that members want to do. These written forms are good for recordkeeping, lab management, and are important for keeping detailed information of projects being performed in labs. They are also good tools for tracking projects in the long-term. For this reason, we also recommend members update their proposal documents quarterly or bi-annually as projects change and develop over time. Members may be incentivized to maintain and update their proposals because the information they provide can be helpful in connecting members with similar interests, assessing lab members' equipment and reagent needs, deciding on new purchases, avoiding cross contamination, and preparing grant proposals. Contracts and Member Agreements We strongly recommend that all members be required to sign some form of legal contract to work in community labs. These membership agreements typically include all or some of the following: Access and key policies Agreement to abide by safety rules Code of conduct statements Policies about damages caused by members or guests Data policy Description of fees and due dates Different types of membership Eligibility Explanation of benefits\u2014use of the lab and storage space, mentoring, discounts, etc. Guest policy Health risks to immune-compromised members Intellectual property Liability release Lost or abandoned property Membership terms Safe space policy Storage rules Termination rules Value statement (e.g., DIY Biology Code of Ethics ) All of these items should be described clearly, in plain language, and with as much detail as possible. It is a good idea to have the agreement reviewed by a lawyer. Examples of member agreements are available from Genspace , Biomakespace , and BioCurious . [Please upload your lab's examples to provide more resources to the community.] Codes of Conduct Some labs have codes of conduct that are either embedded in the member agreement or are separate documents. Codes of conduct set expectations of behavior in the lab and describe actions that will be taken if the code is violated. Examples are available from BioCurious and Biomakespace . Another example is the Code of Ethics drawn up by participants of the 2018 Global BioSummit , further expanded upon in the Community Ethics Document 1.0 at the 2019 Global Biosummit. Access and Hours Many members of community labs are working in the facility in their spare time, often before or after work hours, or at unusual hours because of the time-consuming nature of lab experiments. With these considerations in mind, many labs allow 24 hour, 7 day a week access to the lab for members. In some labs, this type of open access is given with the caveat that there always needs to be a second person present for safety, that the work done after hours be an approved project that has been vetted, or that members working through the night are required to notify a safety officer. It is a good idea to require members to sign in and out of the space and/or have keys with Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) to allow labs to track members' comings and goings (or at least entering) when staff are not on site. Some labs have camera surveillance of their space. Note that local laws may require posted notification and legal disclosures for any video surveillance in the facility. If members are allowed to work in the lab after hours, and to work alone, there are steps that may be taken to help ensure their safety: Assess the hazards of the lab area to identify existing or potential working alone hazards. Take corrective measures to prevent and minimize hazards or potential incidents. Provide easily accessible emergency equipment, emergency aid, and practical means of obtaining assistance based on the nature and degree of exposure to the hazard. Ensure emergency aid is available and compatible with the member's work. Train members on methods for identification, hazard reduction and prevention when working alone and setting clear action plans for encounters with people who do not belong in the space after hours. Provide an effective form of communication between anyone working alone and the people capable of assisting the individual. Always encourage a buddy system, and ask the member to alert a fellow lab member, partner, or neighbor (even if that person is not in the space) about their whereabouts. Post signage, emergency contact information, and develop a communication system for individuals working alone. These should include a list of phone numbers including the biosafety point person and first responders. Require members to be reachable by cell phone or make a phone service available to members. Ensure that all incidents are reported, investigated, and documented. Ordering and Receiving Materials Monitoring chemicals, reagents, and supplies that come into the laboratory is crucial for maintaining a safe lab. Community labs manage this in various ways. When it comes to chemicals and reagents, some labs require that the lab managers place all of the orders for members, while others allow members to place their own orders, provided that the items were pre-approved by the safety officer. For example, at BioCurious, every chemical must have an owner who is responsible for the chemical, and their name must be written on it, even if it is a commonly shared chemical. Owners are responsible for submitting any new chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDS) forms to the safety officers. At Biomakespace, all chemicals were included in the project proposal and risk assessment, labelled with the project or user name, and added to the chemical inventory on arrival in the space. Some states in the U.S. require that inventories be electronically filed with the state. Most labs keep lists of all of the chemicals that come into the space and conduct regular inventories to update the list. This inventory is important, particularly for emergency responders, such as the fire department, to know what is in the space. There are some chemical inventory systems (e.g., https://www.cheminventory.net/ ) that allow barcodes and labels to be printed and have free tiers up to a certain number of containers. Donation of Supplies \"Donations\" (or dumping) of unwanted reagents, supplies, or equipment can pose a serious health and safety hazard, put a strain on limited lab storage space, or impose significant costs for disposal. Most labs have rules prohibiting members from accepting donations of chemicals and supplies on behalf of the lab without pre-approval from the lab manager. This can help prevent potentially hazardous chemicals from entering the lab and prevent duplicates of equipment that could pile up. This also helps to keep inventories up to date, which is important for safety and accounting and ensures that any donation paperwork reconciles with what is actually on the shelves. | BOX: Don't Let This Happen to Your Lab Some real-world examples of unwanted \"donations\" with which community labs have had to contend include: - A large jar of mercury - Containers of unknown reagents with illegible or missing labels - A 2kg can of a chemical that is prone to self-heating and bursting into flame when left open - An antique gas-powered autoclave weighing 300lbs - Equipment with odd discoloration from chemical stains or covered in orange chemical powder - Centrifuge rotors with hardened chemical deposits - Equipment dripping with sludge and goo - Freezers that stink like death - Several -80\u00b0C freezer boxes with undocumented storage strains and plasmids from a failed startup - Equipment with unclear provenance and prominent radioactivity or biohazard warning labels; check for warning stickers, even those that are half peeled - 100g sodium azide (\"enough to poison the entire watershed if it had gone down the drain\") - Canisters of human sperm, bull sperm, etc. | | --- | Storage of Member Supplies Offering members storage space for project supplies can be helpful for the success of their projects. It is a good idea to specify which storage locations are considered \"inside\" or \"outside\" of the lab area and what is and is not allowed to be stored in these spaces (for example, gelatin and agar commonly used to make bioplastics can be stored outside the lab, but should not be consumed). Community labs should avoid the inappropriate storage of hazardous chemicals, reagents, or equipment. As such, we recommend that labs specify prohibited chemicals and organisms from being stored in these locations. Materials should be kept in labeled, clear containers of uniform size to make it easier to screen things that are being stored. Easily understood policies need to be established to prevent members from over encumbering freezer or refrigerator space. Many spaces limit members to a specific number of boxes or particular size or scope of storage bins and boxes. Storage space management policies should be outlined clearly, requiring labeling and cleanout dates. Frequent cleanouts of storage space should be communicated and performed on a regular schedule. These messages should be posted on doors, sent via email, and shared through personal communication. Membership agreements should also address reagents or materials that will be discarded or placed in a quarantine bin or box until disposal and detail how the owner will be contacted and how long the reagents will remain in the quarantine box (often nicknamed the \"box of shame\"). Example Storage Policies BioCurious: \"We really have designed the lab, architecturally, to be transparent. Walls are mostly absent, people can see through the space, almost all storage is required to be transparent, so items are easier to find and somewhat on display, rather than tucked in drawers or cabinets.\" Offering to members: Member bin. We offer members storage for a fee. To arrange this, email us. Storage needs to be clearly labeled with your first and last name. See also the Counter Culture Labs Space rules . Youth Policies For safety and insurance purposes, many community labs do not allow youth under 18 years of age into their space unless accompanied by an adult guardian. Check with your insurance provider to confirm their policy. Some community biology labs restrict youth under the age of 18 from working alone in the lab, but allow youth (mostly 14+ years old) to work or volunteer if supervised by an adult parent or mentor. Some labs restrict the number of youth that can be supervised by an adult mentor at one time. Local laws and regulations may also impose limits on how many minors can be in the space and/or require stricter building codes and background checks for staff.The NIH has this policy for youth working in lab space. Those labs that allow youth to have their own membership, require that they work during regular operating hours, when staff is onsite. Most labs welcome youth to participate in lab trainings, courses, and workshops, as long as an adult is participating with them. Policies should also be outlined for any violation of the membership agreement policies. It is good practice to have a safeguarding or child protection policy (for example, see the Biomakespace policy or the Omni Commons Safer Space policy ) that outlines practices that minimize risks of harm from behaviors such as bullying, harassment or abuse, and a response policy. This is especially important if minors are not accompanied by adults. This policy may be linked to a general code of conduct, but we recommend designating a responsible person to keep up-to-date with best practices specifically for youth because they are more vulnerable to harm. In some countries there are regulations around activities and teaching undertaken with youth under 18 years of age which include requirements for vetting, criminal records checks, or other requirements. Note: Laws and insurance requirements will vary about working with minors depending on where your lab is located. You should check your local/national laws before starting programs with minors. Visitor and Guest Policies If members are permitted to bring guests into the space, it's important that membership contracts state who is liable for the guests and what access rights the guests have (e.g., non-lab areas only or lab access under direct supervision of the host). If member's guests' contact details will be used to add them to any mailing lists or follow-up with recruitment information, or if there is an expectation that frequent or repeat guests become members, it is useful to include this in a written policy or in the membership agreement so members are aware before they bring guests to the lab. We recommend creating a sign in and sign out procedure to keep track of guests who have been in the space (this is often necessary for fire safety reasons in any case). We strongly recommend that anyone entering your space (visitors, volunteers, school groups, etc.) read and sign a liability release waiver. (For example, these are Genspace's general waiver and volunteer/intern waiver and BioCurious'a general waiver and family membership waiver and agreement .) [Please add your examples here.] Insurance and Worker's Compensation Public liability, general insurance, or umbrella policies: Given inherent risks in any lab, we recommend that labs acquire insurance to cover potential incidents that might cause injury to guests, members, volunteers, and employees. Without insurance, if someone has been injured, your organization and potentially you personally may be liable for the costs. These could easily bankrupt a community lab, and put members, staff, and board members at risk. Note that the status of volunteers is ambiguous, but if they have a role description they are likely to be considered employees for insurance purposes. Check with your insurer. Contents or renters insurance: We recommend that you insure your lab and its contents in the event of a fire, theft, or other unforeseen events. Many landlords require insurance. Please inquire. Directors and officers insurance: Most nonprofit organizations have this type of insurance to cover their directors for claims made against them for the management of the organisation. Seek advice about appropriate coverage from an insurance broker who has experience working with biotech companies or science centers. Events and contractor insurance: Specific events might require their own insurance or an insurance rider for use of facilities. We recommend reviewing insurance that your contractors and service providers hold. For example, if a service provider damages something in your lab while trying to repair it, who would be liable? Also create a policy on those who might use your space for their own purposes. For example, if an independent instructor uses your space to run their own workshops, do they have their own public liability insurance or is there an expectation that you are covering their activities under your own insurance? Parties that are open to the public and/or serve alcohol may also require special event permits from the city or police department. Other types of insurance: Make sure to check local regulations for unusual insurance requirements! In the United Kingdom, and possibly other countries, labs with autoclaves are required to have special insurance due to legislation for pressure vessels (UK Pressure Systems Safety Regulations of 2000, which requires that an autoclave be inspected by an insurer-approved person every year.) Working with Startups and Commercial Businesses Many community labs open their doors to start-up companies or individuals pursuing a business. Ensure that the company understands and is supportive of the mission and goals of the community lab and is held to the same standards as other members of the lab. These standards should include openness, transparency and inclusivity (within reason). Most community labs choose not to claim any ownership of the start-ups intellectual property (IP) and expect that the same openness is reciprocated. Corporate members should be able to provide enough information about their projects to conduct a safety assessment. Because they are working in a community lab where open sharing is part of the culture, the company should be informed that it is responsible for protecting its IP. Corporate members sometimes ask lab management or other members to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This can expose the lab and its members to legal risks or responsibilities that may infringe upon the community lab's culture of openness. In most cases, we recommend that community labs and their members do not sign NDAs and that this is written into your policies. If you do choose to sign one, we recommend seeking legal advice. Aside from IP and disclosure considerations, startups and commercial projects will generally use the lab under the same terms as other members and should be required to sign membership agreements. Ensure that companies are clear about what they can expect from the staff (typically volunteers) of the lab. Our experience has been that some corporate members do not understand the nature of community labs and expect a professional service\u2014this can be frustrating for both sides and it's best to manage any misconceptions early on even if turning down income is difficult. | BOX: Some real-world examples of challenges encountered working with companies include: Expecting volunteers to do their dishes, order reagents, spend lab funds on equipment the startup needs, make a financial investment in their company, perform regular equipment maintenance, review their startup pitch, provide market data, and answer many questions. Expecting volunteers to coordinate their use of the lab, instead of joining lab communication channels to directly ask other members and lab users. Making exceptions to safety or ethics policies for \"just this one experiment.\" Filling every available space with large orders of consumables like pipette tips and not complying with storage guidelines. Constantly trying to negotiate on membership prices and get discounts and reductions to unreasonable levels. Getting many items delivered to the space and not dealing with them in a timely manner. Particularly unexpected deliveries of large equipment or reagents that need refrigeration and expecting that a volunteer will be around to deal with it. Trying to get a lab to sign a blanket IP disclosure NDA for the entire lab and it's members and other companies projects, usually seen as an IP grab by a VC (see recommendation above to intentionally avoid signing NDAs). Expecting that their contractors can come into the space as \"guests\" for several weeks at a time and being reluctant to pay for an additional membership because \"they don't need their own access card.\" | | --- | Despite the challenges of working with companies, these are infrequent incidents and many community labs have excellent relationships with their startup members. Company memberships often contribute financially in ways that can be critical to community lab business models, and they are important community members in many other ways. They may be more available in the lab than individual members and willing to assist with lab management, taking deliveries, publicizing the space within the startup and investment community, helping pay for new facilities and servicing of equipment, writing the space into grants, and donating back. Be mindful and review your policies to maximize the mutual benefits of working with startups and commercial projects in a way that all parties feel good.","title":"Chapter 1"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#laboratory-management-practices","text":"","title":"Laboratory Management Practices"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#organizational-structure-and-safety-officer-roles","text":"In community biology there is no one standard or \"right\" way to structure the organizing team.

Also, it is suggested to develop approaches for \"On the spot\" training for resources when members seem to lack proficiency. In addition to the project proposal form, some labs ask members to fill out a Risk Assessment Form that is reviewed by the safety team. The Risk Assessment Form helps members think through the potential hazards of their project and to plan mitigation strategies. In some countries, for example the UK, the regulations for any experiments with genetically modified organisms require written risk assessments to humans and to the environment for which \"competent advice\" (as described in the UK Genetically Modified Organisms Contained Use Regulations 2014 ) is obtained before the experiment can start. Labs such as Biomakespace in the UK, therefore, also have a form that is specific for any GM work that members want to do. These written forms are good for recordkeeping, lab management, and are important for keeping detailed information of projects being performed in labs. They are also good tools for tracking projects in the long-term. For this reason, we also recommend members update their proposal documents quarterly or bi-annually as projects change and develop over time. Members may be incentivized to maintain and update their proposals because the information they provide can be helpful in connecting members with similar interests, assessing lab members' equipment and reagent needs, deciding on new purchases, avoiding cross contamination, and preparing grant proposals.","title":"Process for Proposing Projects and Vetting"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#contracts-and-member-agreements","text":"We strongly recommend that all members be required to sign some form of legal contract to work in community labs.

With these considerations in mind, many labs allow 24 hour, 7 day a week access to the lab for members. In some labs, this type of open access is given with the caveat that there always needs to be a second person present for safety, that the work done after hours be an approved project that has been vetted, or that members working through the night are required to notify a safety officer. It is a good idea to require members to sign in and out of the space and/or have keys with Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) to allow labs to track members' comings and goings (or at least entering) when staff are not on site. Some labs have camera surveillance of their space. Note that local laws may require posted notification and legal disclosures for any video surveillance in the facility. If members are allowed to work in the lab after hours, and to work alone, there are steps that may be taken to help ensure their safety: Assess the hazards of the lab area to identify existing or potential working alone hazards. Take corrective measures to prevent and minimize hazards or potential incidents. Provide easily accessible emergency equipment, emergency aid, and practical means of obtaining assistance based on the nature and degree of exposure to the hazard. Ensure emergency aid is available and compatible with the member's work. Train members on methods for identification, hazard reduction and prevention when working alone and setting clear action plans for encounters with people who do not belong in the space after hours. Provide an effective form of communication between anyone working alone and the people capable of assisting the individual. Always encourage a buddy system, and ask the member to alert a fellow lab member, partner, or neighbor (even if that person is not in the space) about their whereabouts. Post signage, emergency contact information, and develop a communication system for individuals working alone. These should include a list of phone numbers including the biosafety point person and first responders. Require members to be reachable by cell phone or make a phone service available to members. Ensure that all incidents are reported, investigated, and documented.","title":"Access and Hours"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#ordering-and-receiving-materials","text":"Monitoring chemicals, reagents, and supplies that come into the laboratory is crucial for maintaining a safe lab. Community labs manage this in various ways. When it comes to chemicals and reagents, some labs require that the lab managers place all of the orders for members, while others allow members to place their own orders, provided that the items were pre-approved by the safety officer. For example, at BioCurious, every chemical must have an owner who is responsible for the chemical, and their name must be written on it, even if it is a commonly shared chemical. Owners are responsible for submitting any new chemical Safety Data Sheets (SDS) forms to the safety officers. At Biomakespace, all chemicals were included in the project proposal and risk assessment, labelled with the project or user name, and added to the chemical inventory on arrival in the space. Some states in the U.S. require that inventories be electronically filed with the state. Most labs keep lists of all of the chemicals that come into the space and conduct regular inventories to update the list. This inventory is important, particularly for emergency responders, such as the fire department, to know what is in the space. There are some chemical inventory systems (e.g., https://www.cheminventory.net/ ) that allow barcodes and labels to be printed and have free tiers up to a certain number of containers.","title":"Ordering and Receiving Materials"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Chapter%201/#donation-of-supplies","text":"\"Donations\" (or dumping) of unwanted reagents, supplies, or equipment can pose a serious health and safety hazard, put a strain on limited lab storage space, or impose significant costs for disposal.

This can help prevent potentially hazardous chemicals from entering the lab and prevent duplicates of equipment that could pile up. This also helps to keep inventories up to date, which is important for safety and accounting and ensures that any donation paperwork reconciles with what is actually on the shelves. | BOX: Don't Let This Happen to Your Lab Some real-world examples of unwanted \"donations\" with which community labs have had to contend include: - A large jar of mercury - Containers of unknown reagents with illegible or missing labels - A 2kg can of a chemical that is prone to self-heating and bursting into flame when left open - An antique gas-powered autoclave weighing 300lbs - Equipment with odd discoloration from chemical stains or covered in orange chemical powder - Centrifuge rotors with hardened chemical deposits - Equipment dripping with sludge and goo - Freezers that stink like death - Several -80\u00b0C freezer boxes with undocumented storage strains and plasmids from a failed startup - Equipment with unclear provenance and prominent radioactivity or biohazard warning labels; check for warning stickers, even those that are half peeled - 100g sodium azide (\"enough to poison the entire watershed if it had gone down the drain\") - Canisters of human sperm, bull sperm, etc. | | --- |","title":"Donation of Supplies"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#_2","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Chapter%201/#storage-of-member-supplies","text":"Offering members storage space for project supplies can be helpful for the success of their projects. It is a good idea to specify which storage locations are considered \"inside\" or \"outside\" of the lab area and what is and is not allowed to be stored in these spaces (for example, gelatin and agar commonly used to make bioplastics can be stored outside the lab, but should not be consumed). Community labs should avoid the inappropriate storage of hazardous chemicals, reagents, or equipment. As such, we recommend that labs specify prohibited chemicals and organisms from being stored in these locations. Materials should be kept in labeled, clear containers of uniform size to make it easier to screen things that are being stored. Easily understood policies need to be established to prevent members from over encumbering freezer or refrigerator space. Many spaces limit members to a specific number of boxes or particular size or scope of storage bins and boxes. Storage space management policies should be outlined clearly, requiring labeling and cleanout dates. Frequent cleanouts of storage space should be communicated and performed on a regular schedule. These messages should be posted on doors, sent via email, and shared through personal communication. Membership agreements should also address reagents or materials that will be discarded or placed in a quarantine bin or box until disposal and detail how the owner will be contacted and how long the reagents will remain in the quarantine box (often nicknamed the \"box of shame\"). Example Storage Policies BioCurious: \"We really have designed the lab, architecturally, to be transparent. Walls are mostly absent, people can see through the space, almost all storage is required to be transparent, so items are easier to find and somewhat on display, rather than tucked in drawers or cabinets.\" Offering to members: Member bin.

Check with your insurance provider to confirm their policy. Some community biology labs restrict youth under the age of 18 from working alone in the lab, but allow youth (mostly 14+ years old) to work or volunteer if supervised by an adult parent or mentor. Some labs restrict the number of youth that can be supervised by an adult mentor at one time. Local laws and regulations may also impose limits on how many minors can be in the space and/or require stricter building codes and background checks for staff.The NIH has this policy for youth working in lab space. Those labs that allow youth to have their own membership, require that they work during regular operating hours, when staff is onsite. Most labs welcome youth to participate in lab trainings, courses, and workshops, as long as an adult is participating with them. Policies should also be outlined for any violation of the membership agreement policies. It is good practice to have a safeguarding or child protection policy (for example, see the Biomakespace policy or the Omni Commons Safer Space policy ) that outlines practices that minimize risks of harm from behaviors such as bullying, harassment or abuse, and a response policy. This is especially important if minors are not accompanied by adults. This policy may be linked to a general code of conduct, but we recommend designating a responsible person to keep up-to-date with best practices specifically for youth because they are more vulnerable to harm. In some countries there are regulations around activities and teaching undertaken with youth under 18 years of age which include requirements for vetting, criminal records checks, or other requirements. Note: Laws and insurance requirements will vary about working with minors depending on where your lab is located. You should check your local/national laws before starting programs with minors.","title":"Youth Policies"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#visitor-and-guest-policies","text":"If members are permitted to bring guests into the space, it's important that membership contracts state who is liable for the guests and what access rights the guests have (e.g., non-lab areas only or lab access under direct supervision of the host). If member's guests' contact details will be used to add them to any mailing lists or follow-up with recruitment information, or if there is an expectation that frequent or repeat guests become members, it is useful to include this in a written policy or in the membership agreement so members are aware before they bring guests to the lab. We recommend creating a sign in and sign out procedure to keep track of guests who have been in the space (this is often necessary for fire safety reasons in any case). We strongly recommend that anyone entering your space (visitors, volunteers, school groups, etc.) read and sign a liability release waiver. (For example, these are Genspace's general waiver and volunteer/intern waiver and BioCurious'a general waiver and family membership waiver and agreement .) [Please add your examples here.]","title":"Visitor and Guest Policies"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#insurance-and-workers-compensation","text":"Public liability, general insurance, or umbrella policies: Given inherent risks in any lab, we recommend that labs acquire insurance to cover potential incidents that might cause injury to guests, members, volunteers, and employees. Without insurance, if someone has been injured, your organization and potentially you personally may be liable for the costs. These could easily bankrupt a community lab, and put members, staff, and board members at risk. Note that the status of volunteers is ambiguous, but if they have a role description they are likely to be considered employees for insurance purposes. Check with your insurer. Contents or renters insurance: We recommend that you insure your lab and its contents in the event of a fire, theft, or other unforeseen events. Many landlords require insurance. Please inquire. Directors and officers insurance: Most nonprofit organizations have this type of insurance to cover their directors for claims made against them for the management of the organisation. Seek advice about appropriate coverage from an insurance broker who has experience working with biotech companies or science centers. Events and contractor insurance: Specific events might require their own insurance or an insurance rider for use of facilities. We recommend reviewing insurance that your contractors and service providers hold. For example, if a service provider damages something in your lab while trying to repair it, who would be liable? Also create a policy on those who might use your space for their own purposes. For example, if an independent instructor uses your space to run their own workshops, do they have their own public liability insurance or is there an expectation that you are covering their activities under your own insurance? Parties that are open to the public and/or serve alcohol may also require special event permits from the city or police department. Other types of insurance: Make sure to check local regulations for unusual insurance requirements! In the United Kingdom, and possibly other countries, labs with autoclaves are required to have special insurance due to legislation for pressure vessels (UK Pressure Systems Safety Regulations of 2000, which requires that an autoclave be inspected by an insurer-approved person every year.)","title":"Insurance and Worker&#39;s Compensation"},{"location":"Chapter%201/#working-with-startups-and-commercial-businesses","text":"Many community labs open their doors to start-up companies or individuals pursuing a business. Ensure that the company understands and is supportive of the mission and goals of the community lab and is held to the same standards as other members of the lab. These standards should include openness, transparency and inclusivity (within reason). Most community labs choose not to claim any ownership of the start-ups intellectual property (IP) and expect that the same openness is reciprocated. Corporate members should be able to provide enough information about their projects to conduct a safety assessment. Because they are working in a community lab where open sharing is part of the culture, the company should be informed that it is responsible for protecting its IP. Corporate members sometimes ask lab management or other members to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). This can expose the lab and its members to legal risks or responsibilities that may infringe upon the community lab's culture of openness. In most cases, we recommend that community labs and their members do not sign NDAs and that this is written into your policies. If you do choose to sign one, we recommend seeking legal advice. Aside from IP and disclosure considerations, startups and commercial projects will generally use the lab under the same terms as other members and should be required to sign membership agreements. Ensure that companies are clear about what they can expect from the staff (typically volunteers) of the lab. Our experience has been that some corporate members do not understand the nature of community labs and expect a professional service\u2014this can be frustrating for both sides and it's best to manage any misconceptions early on even if turning down income is difficult. | BOX: Some real-world examples of challenges encountered working with companies include: Expecting volunteers to do their dishes, order reagents, spend lab funds on equipment the startup needs, make a financial investment in their company, perform regular equipment maintenance, review their startup pitch, provide market data, and answer many questions.

Making exceptions to safety or ethics policies for \"just this one experiment.\" Filling every available space with large orders of consumables like pipette tips and not complying with storage guidelines. Constantly trying to negotiate on membership prices and get discounts and reductions to unreasonable levels. Getting many items delivered to the space and not dealing with them in a timely manner. Particularly unexpected deliveries of large equipment or reagents that need refrigeration and expecting that a volunteer will be around to deal with it. Trying to get a lab to sign a blanket IP disclosure NDA for the entire lab and it's members and other companies projects, usually seen as an IP grab by a VC (see recommendation above to intentionally avoid signing NDAs). Expecting that their contractors can come into the space as \"guests\" for several weeks at a time and being reluctant to pay for an additional membership because \"they don't need their own access card.\" | | --- | Despite the challenges of working with companies, these are infrequent incidents and many community labs have excellent relationships with their startup members. Company memberships often contribute financially in ways that can be critical to community lab business models, and they are important community members in many other ways.

Whether starting a lab from scratch or converting a garage or other space, there are some common infrastructure and design aspects that are important to keep in mind. First, before thinking about the inside of the lab, consider the outside and the building that will house the community lab. When searching for a location, consider the following: Zoning. City zoning laws specify how property in specific locations may be used. For example, city officials will define whether a particular area can be residential, commercial, or mixed-use. If the community lab is going to be used as a business, it will need to be located in a zone that allows for commercial use. Zoning may also affect where labs can be located, where externally vented chemical hoods can be used, etc. Contact the local public works office for more information. Neighborhood. Consider if the neighbors are biotech friendly ahead of time. Neighbors are an important part of the community and can be advocates for the organization. Get to know them and invite them to tour the facility and participate in educational opportunities. Also, consider who might be uncomfortable with a lab next door, such as restaurants. Make a point of establishing rapport with such businesses. Access. Consider whether the location is accessible by public transit and if parking is available. Also, consider local events, such as sporting matches, that may take place in the area. Additionally, consider access for persons with disabilities. Review the ADA's Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities for more information. Safety and security. Consider the safety of the area, surrounding lighting, and surveillance options if in a high crime area. Building infrastructure . Consider whether the building has a sprinkler system, a loading dock, or doors wide enough for large equipment such as a -80\u00b0C freezer or a biosafety cabinet to pass through. It is advisable to have more than one exit from the labspace. You'll need an available sink. Another consideration is power\u2014how many electrical outlets are available and what is the maximum load on the main breaker panel? Other considerations include: are there separate rooms you could rent out? Is there a kitchen area that is well-separated from the lab? Is there a large room outside the lab that can be used as a lecture area or classroom? Environmental and Health Considerations Once a space has been identified or inherited, consider the following environmental issues: Potentially contaminated sites. Before settling on a location, determine past uses of the land and the facility. Determine if hazardous materials still exist on the property. One way to do this in the U.S. is to visit the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website of known Superfund Sites or ToxMap http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov . Asbestos. Asbestos is a natural mineral that is known to cause cancer if inhaled. Be aware that flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, pipe wrappings, and insulation may contain asbestos. Visit the U.S. EPA's asbestos website to learn more about asbestos and to find local vendors who can assist with asbestos remediation. Radioactivity . Radioactivity testing should be performed and decontaminated if discovered. Contact a radiation safety company to assess potential radiation contamination. Mercury. Mercury can be found in many products, such as thermometers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, manometers, and other pieces of scientific equipment. Be aware that mercury may be found in sink traps or under floor tiles if the space was ever previously used as a lab or was part of a production facility that used mercury. Visit the EPA's mercury website for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with mercury remediation. Lead and lead paint . Lead was banned from U.S. paint products in 1978 but may still be used in other countries. Buildings and structures with lead paint require special precautions, especially if the paint will be removed. You can buy community lead testing kits online or at your local home improvement store. Visit the EPA's lead website for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with lead remediation. Natural disaster zones . Consider the location of the community facility and whether it will be located in a flood , fire hazards, landslide, earthquake liquefaction, or other zone prone to natural disasters. Be aware that some insurance companies will not provide flood insurance to facilities in flood zones. Contact an insurance company to determine if the facility is in a flood zone. Establishing Contact with Local Agencies We recommend establishing rapport with key personnel at local fire departments, police precincts, and hospitals, so that if an incident does occur, first responders and police are familiar with your lab, its mission, and operations. Establishing such relationships could preempt misunderstandings about your lab's purpose, aid in the response to an incident, establish champions of the lab in the community, and help provide advice in lab safety and security and local ordinances. After establishing your lab, reach out to your local fire and police department before any potential incident. Invite them for a tour of the lab or to a community event to give them a sense of the lab facilities and activities. A few examples of local agencies to contact include: Local fire departments. In some areas, community labs may need a permit from the local fire department. Before building the lab, it is a good idea to contact the local fire department and find out about the local requirements. Typical fire codes set allowances on the amounts of hazardous chemicals in a building and can require additional fire protection (such as fire sprinklers) depending on the local zoning requirements, the materials used in the facility, and the materials used in the construction or renovation of the building. Contacting the fire department early in the process is helpful for identifying these requirements. Public Health Department. Inquire with the local Public Health Department to find out about health codes that pertain to labs or if there are reporting requirements in the event of an exposure or accident. In different localities, you may also be required to contact branches dedicated to the management of chemical and regulated medical waste. Local Chamber of Commerce or neighborhood association. Some community labs have successfully obtained support from their local chambers of commerce, which has more deeply integrated them into their communities. Consider asking chamber officials to visit your lab and inviting potential funding groups to tour when they visit your city. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or Local Law Enforcement Agencies. Many community labs have found it beneficial to establish relationships with agents at local FBI offices to identify and address any misconceptions of the nature of the research happening in the lab. For advice on how to reach out to the FBI, contact the heads of community labs in the U.S. (e.g., Biocurious, Genspace). Lab Infrastructure and Design When setting up a community biology lab, consider the equipment and materials you will use and the basic infrastructure required to handle them. Whether setting up a space for the first time, moving to a new space, or settling into the space, consider the following list of recommendations for the infrastructure and design of a biology lab. Walls and floors. The lab walls, ceilings, and floors should be smooth, impermeable to liquids and easy to clean. Walls should be fire resistant with no carpet or flammable materials on the wall or barriers. Walls and entryways should separate the lab from non-lab areas. Floors should be slip-resistant, durable, and easily cleaned. Floors should not be carpeted because the fabric may absorb chemicals and dirt and is very difficult to clean. Chemicals that soak into carpet may also cause reactions long after the chemical spill. Carpet may also become a breeding ground for microbes. Benchtops . Benchtops should be impermeable to liquids, including disinfectants, and other chemicals such as acids and solvents. Benchtops should be resistant to scratches, impact, and heat. They should not have open seams and should be easy to clean and decontaminate. If your benchtops are wooden, or if only wood benches are available, make sure that they are sealed with an impermeable surface, such as a sealed tile or epoxy coating. Porous materials such as wood veneer products should be avoided as they will absorb chemicals and water and will weaken over time. Wood-grain plastic laminate or phenolic resin may provide an acceptable alternative. Previously used stainless steel food preparation tables (shown below) may be purchased and make wonderful lab benches (30 inch x 60 inch tables are approximately $130 new). Furniture stores, such as Ikea, sell tempered glass and all-metal tables, but be wary of fiberboard or laminate filled products. Sink . A sink for handwashing,dishwashing, and for disposal of non-toxic and non-hazardous liquids should be provided. Sinks should be located near the exit door. If this is not possible, ensure the sink is located as close to the lab as possible. A gooseneck or adjustable faucet and deep pan sink are highly recommended. Many stainless steel sinks from restaurants going out of business are available from auction sales and make wonderful lab sinks. A dish rack for drying glassware that drains into the sink is also helpful. The sink should never be located in an area that is used for food preparation. If running water is not available, containers of water and hand sanitizer must be available. A portable handwashing station with clean and dirty water containers may be an acceptable solution as long as it is emptied and refilled on a regular basis. Lab furniture. Chairs and stools should be non-porous and easily cleaned. Chairs made of vinyl, hard plastic, and hard rubber make good choices. Plastic coverings that can be easily cleaned may be used to cover cloth chairs. Benches and other lab furniture, such as shelving and cabinets, should be of a sturdy design and material to support equipment and storage items. The U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) lab Design Requirements Manual (DRM) specifies that shelves should be able to hold 50 pounds per linear foot for 1 foot deep shelves. It is recommended that countertops be able to hold no less than 50 pounds per square foot. Shelving with adjustable height shelves are recommended. If located in a seismically active area, restraints and anchorage for shelving and cabinets may be necessary and is often required by local building codes. Storage space . Community labs often get their supplies and equipment from donations, auctions, or discount sales. It is important to have adequate storage space for and consider storage requirements for frequently accessed items as well as \"deep storage\" for less frequently used items. We recommend creating clearly labeled storage spaces inside and outside the lab and discouraging clutter on benchtops or in aisles. Make it easy to see what is stored where: consider using well-labeled and transparent boxes to easily see the contents. PPE storage space . Storage space for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as lab coats, gloves, and goggles, should be available throughout the lab. Make sure that any workstation or equipment that requires PPE is labeled with a sign. PPE should be stationed at the lab entrance with signage and available to visitors to the space. Personal storage space . Non-lab items such as coats and bags should be stored outside the lab (e.g., on coat racks, hooks, cubbies, closet). Personal or project storage space on shelves and in fridges or freezers is usually allowed at the discretion of lab management. All items should be clearly labeled with the owner's name and the contents. Office space . Demarcate space for eating, drinking, class, or office work that is outside the lab. Check local zoning requirements to determine if labs and offices must be physically separated. Lighting. The lab should have adequate lighting for work at all times during the day. We recommend providing task lighting at the bench or directly by work areas if possible. Reflections and glare should be avoided. Areas containing equipment with ultraviolet (UV) lighting should be limited to those doing work when UV lamps are on, which should only be as necessary. When possible, use a self-timing light switch in rooms that are seldom used as the switches can save a significant amount of money. It is also a good idea to have access to emergency lighting, such as a flashlight, in the case of an electrical outage. Glow-in-the-dark signs can be used to guide lab users to the flashlight and other safety equipment. Doors. If possible, doors to the lab should have vision panels, be self-closing, and have the appropriate fire rating . Locking doors with restricted access is important for the prevention of theft, as well as for the physical safety of the lab users. Always ensure that the doors have the proper emergency egress opening direction and are outfitted with panic bars or emergency door release buttons if necessary (check your local fire department). Consider egress routes in the event of an emergency. It is advisable to have two exits from the lab. Electricity. Biolabs tend to require greater electrical loads than commercial office spaces. You can estimate the loads you need by adding up the wattage used by individual pieces in the lab. Be sure to tally continuously-on loads (such as fridges and freezers) versus peak loads (such as autoclaves or large centrifuges). You can also do load testing to identify your power needs. All electrical work should be up to code. Make sure the breaker panel is carefully labeled with what circuits or equipment each breaker powers, so they can be safely deactivated in case of emergency. It may be useful to also label each outlet with the number of the breaker that powers it. Check that all power cords are in good condition (especially with older second-hand equipment) and rated for the amperage of the equipment (see Chapter 9 - Equipment Usage/Safety ). Many labs start small and grow over time, so it is important to anticipate a higher energy load in the long term. Make sure power is available away from wall sockets. Power drops from the ceiling are not expensive and may save lab personnel from daisy-chaining power cords (which are trip and fire hazards and are likely to violate fire ordinances). Temperature and energy input monitors on important equipment (such as ultra-low temperature freezers) can provide early warning before equipment failures. If possible, it is desirable to have a generator for use with essential equipment like incubators and freezers incase of an electrical outage. Electrical safety devices . Labs should have Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) in the electrical receptacles in order to minimize the risks associated with electrical equipment (e.g., shock, electrocution). The GFCI should be tested at least once a year, because they can corrode or become damaged. Learn how to perform a test here . Eyewash and shower . We recommend providing access to an eyewash station, which may also be required by safety regulations. Eyewashes can be plumbed in or you can buy single-use squirt bottles with sterile saline solution (don't worry they're cheap!). Remember that: Eyewash stations have a limited lifetime and need to be replaced; set calendar reminders to do so. Fixed eyewash stations should be flushed monthly or per local regulations. Emergency showers are typically only required if lab users will be exposed to \"injurious corrosive materials\" ( ANSI 358.1) . Refer to the international standard ANSI 358.1 for additional recommendations for eyewashes and shower equipment. Fire safety equipment. Fire extinguishers and smoke detectors are often legally required. It is also advisable (and often required) for the lab to have sprinklers and a fire alarm. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes require labs to carry fire suppression equipment such as fire extinguishers and fire sprinkler heads. Fire extinguishers should use carbon dioxide or dry chemical (type A-B-C extinguishers) to put out fires. Water is not a good option for labs. If you use combustible metals such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, consider Type D fire extinguishers, which also use a dry chemical but dispense it more gently. If you plan to work with highly flammable materials, first consult with your local fire department. We also recommend keeping a fire blanket on hand. Local fire departments and fire service companies may inspect and fill fire extinguishers and offer free training on their use. Fire extinguishers must be inspected by a certified inspector annually. Refer to Chapter 6 Emergency Procedures for more information on Fire Safety. Ventilation . If building a lab, consideration should be given to installing a ventilation system that provides inward airflow without recirculation. Many community labs moving into existing buildings will not have that option but heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals may be able to balance the air in the lab to create a small negative pressure. If mechanical ventilation is not available, windows can be opened but should be fitted with screens to prevent insects from entering the space. If you're able to design the lab, ensure it has separate air handling units for offices, bathrooms, and other spaces. Chemical fume hoods and biological safety cabinets may require their own ventilation and space considerations. Signage The lab is often full of signs, which is a good thing and important for the safety of users. Many signs tend to go unnoticed by very regular users of the lab. That said, signs serve as useful reminders and are especially important for new users and for emergency responders to the lab. Signs also instruct users where things are and help them understand the lab rules (see some example signs from BioCurious ). Signage that indicates who to contact and what to do in an emergency should be posted in conspicuous locations throughout the building. Below is a list of signs that are useful and often required in the lab: Location Signs Exits . It is especially useful, and sometimes required by law, to have signs indicating where the exits to the lab and building are located in the event of an emergency and when people need to exit quickly. Fire extinguishers. Signage should be posted to identify the location of the extinguisher. Also, consider posting details regarding how to use the extinguisher. First aid kit. The first aid station safety symbol should be used as it indicates the location and availability of a first aid kit. Eyewash station and safety shower. Signs to identify the location and availability of an eyewash station and safety shower are important. Escape route. A sign that shows the various egress routes in the case of an emergency should be posted. Warnings, Caution Signs, and Symbols Biohazard symbol. The biohazard symbol warns of lab equipment (e.g., fridges, freezers, centrifuges) that contains biohazardous materials or could be contaminated with biohazardous materials. These should only be used if the material warrants posting such signage, e.g., the material is classified as Biosafety Level 2 (see Chapter 13 - Biological Safety ) and is likely or known to contain pathogens. This could include materials such as blood samples or primary human cell lines. High voltage. The high voltage warning symbol, which includes a lightning bolt arrow in a yellow triangle, warns of voltage high enough to cause serious injury or death. If working with high voltage, consider using an isolation transformer and other appropriate high-voltage safeguards and PPE. You can find guidance on this topic elsewhere\u2014this handbook focuses primarily on biological and chemical safety. Signage should be posted that indicates how to turn off the main power in case of an accident or emergency. Specific dangers. Additional signage that identifies specific hazardous areas/equipment should be posted. Examples include: Wet Floor; Sonicating - Do Not Enter; UV Light; Lasers in Use; Cryogens; and Compressed Gas. Some signs will be required by law in certain places but not others so check local requirements. Etiquette Reminders No eating/drinking. Inform lab members that eating and/or drinking where hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored is not permitted. Eating and drinking may result in the accidental ingestion of hazardous materials, and food and beverages could also contaminate your lab experiments. Food or drink containers and utensils should not be stored, washed, or dried in the lab. Refrigerators used for storage of research materials must not be used for storage of food or beverages. Labeling reminders. Remind lab users to properly label their materials and reagents with the name of the chemical or biological agent, their name, and the date, so that other members of the lab are aware of the contents. Hand washing. Reminds lab users to wash their hands both before beginning work and when they are finished. No open flame. Prohibits open flame devices, e.g., bunsen burners. These are especially useful near flammable chemicals, although some labs enforce a \"no open flame\" policy throughout the lab. Waste. Helps to ensure that users know where to dispose of biohazardous waste versus recycling or regular trash. Chemical Signage Use signage to demarcate storage locations, cabinets, and equipment that is dedicated for acids, bases, and flammables. Organize stock chemicals by type, alphabetically, or other system (e.g., Flinn system ). Label storage areas clearly so that chemicals can easily be put back in the same location they were taken from. Include signs pointing out the location of and instructions for how to handle chemical spills . Refer to Chapter 10 - Chemical Safety for more details on chemical safety, storage, and signage. PPE Reminder Signage Post signage in areas where extreme heat or cold is located. Always wear heat-resistant gloves for handling items coming out of the autoclave or microwave, as well as reminders for handling cold items with protective gloves. Incompatible glove signage should also be posted at corrosive cabinets or chemical fume hoods as a reminder. Reminders should be posted that describe when it is and isn't appropriate to wear PPE, such as signs on exit doors reminding people to remove lab coats and gloves before leaving the lab. Emergency Contact Information Provide contact information for each of the following: The lab manager(s), staff, or volunteers in charge. Any building personnel that can be reached in an emergency. Local fire department. Local police department. 911, or country equivalent, emergency response number. For freezer emergencies, you may also want to post the nearest locations that sell dry ice. Types of Labs and Specific Considerations This section provides special guidance for different types of community lab facilities. Rented Dedicated Lab Space. A number of community labs rent dedicated space from a commercial landlord. It's important to know the zoning for such a space (usually biology labs require industrial or mixed-use zoning but as with everything it depends on local laws). It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord has a clear understanding of the types of activities at your lab, your users, power usage, policies, and hours. The more the landlord knows at the outset, the smoother your relationship will be, and the less potential for conflict in the case of an incident. We recommend occasionally inviting the landlord into the lab as a way to establish a good working relationship. Kitchen or Other Home Lab. The most challenging aspect of the design of a home lab is the separation of the lab space from the living space. It is important not to eat or drink in the space where work is being performed. Avoid setting up a lab on carpeted flooring and make sure that walls and furniture are impermeable (or cover them with plastic tarp). Small dorm fridges and freezers can be bought cheaply second-hand in any college town. If you have roommates or family members who share the space, you may want to mark off the space and establish an understanding about access and safety in the lab. Basement or Garage Lab. Paying attention to the airflow in a garage or basement lab is critical. Too much airflow may increase chances for sample contamination, but too little may not provide adequate ventilation for users. Moisture and mold may also be an issue\u2014you can check mold levels using a simple petri dish kit available at many home improvement stores. Makerspace (Conjoined or Mixed Use). Separation of spaces to reduce dust and vibration is important in a biolab within a makerspace. It's essential to protect the bio area from other makerspace members who may not appreciate the special needs of a biolab. Chemicals and biologicals should be stored in cabinets away from the shared space. Library. Separate porous library books from lab space. University Spaces. Be aware of rules and regulations of the host institution and incorporate them into the policies of your own lab space. We also recommend scheduling regular check-ins with the management of the host institution and outreach events for your neighbors. Be sure to mark off the lab from other spaces in the host facility with lockable doors and clear signage. Mobile Lab (e.g., a Van or a Container). Mobile labs come with special considerations about establishing resilient containment practices for chemicals and organisms. Accidental environmental releases or spills are especially a concern with mobile units that could be involved in traffic accidents. Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles or equivalent governing institution for proper signage and containment procedures for these units. Opening the Lab Before work commences, it is a good idea to review the experimental setup to check for any missing items that will help ensure a safe lab experience for users. This checklist may be used upon moving into the lab. It can also be used for conducting regular safety checks of the lab. Table.

Ensure that no lab materials are left behind and that all lab equipment, fixtures, furniture, and space are properly cleaned and decontaminated to ensure the safety of future occupants and others who may enter the space. You may be legally required to perform a hazardous materials (chemical and biological) walk-through upon ending your lease,which might involve county or state documentation of disposal and closing permitting on sites. The steps involved in decommissioning involve the following: Assess and Audit Assess any hazards that may need attention (e.g., historic records of spills or accidents, known areas of contamination). Determine the amount of time needed to decommission, and plan to end research in the lab 1-2 weeks before starting the process. Clearout and Decontaminate Remove all chemicals and biological materials from lab and storage areas, including refrigerators and freezers. Movable equipment should be appropriately cleaned and/or disinfected and removed from the lab. Decontaminate all surfaces of any chemical or biological contamination. Pay particular attention to ethidium bromide contamination in gel electrophoresis areas. If mercury has been used in the lab, decommissioning should include testing of floors (or under floor tiles), sink traps, cupboards, and molding around furniture and walls. Contact a local remediation company or a nearby college or university to determine if a Jerome meter may be used to test for mercury. Remove dust and other settled particulates via a thorough final wet-cleaning of floors, vertical surfaces, and furniture using commercial cleaning products. Documentation Keep notes of all of the processes. This Decommissioning Checklist may be used to help keep track of all of the items to inspect and complete when decommissioning the lab. Table 2. Laboratory Decommissioning Checklist General --- Inspected Clean off all benches; remove lab matting and clean any spilled materials; wipe down all benches with an appropriate disinfectant Remove all equipment and supplies from the lab Remove all signage and/or placards for specific hazardous materials that are no longer present Remove all debris and equipment from any chemical fume hoods Clean all chemical residues, drips and spills Remove and properly disposed of all disposable liners/covers from work surfaces Clean all fume hood surfaces and walls Clean all potentially contaminated areas (e.g., cabinets, bench tops) Sharps Containers and Broken Glass Inspected Place all razor blades, needles, syringes, pipette tips, etc. in drawers, on benches, shelves, or the floor into appropriate sharps containers Place all non-contaminated broken glassware in rigid, puncture-resistant containers and remove it from the lab Permanently close and surface disinfect sharps containers Compressed Gas Cylinders/Cryogenics Cylinders Inspected Label each cylinder to identify the owner and contents Remove regulators and make sure valve protection caps are securely in place and return all compressed gas cylinders to the vendor if applicable Use cylinder hand trucks when transporting cylinders; do not attempt to move cylinders without these special hand trucks Waste Disposal Inspected Dispose of all hazardous wastes and unwanted chemicals Segregate all labeled hazardous wastes by hazard class Identify all unknown wastes Ensure that each hazardous waste container is leak proof and closed (e.g., lids or caps tightened, debris double bagged and air tight, questionable containers double bagged) Arrange for a hazardous waste pick-up or drop-off for unwanted hazardous waste Biohazards Inspected All biohazardous waste must be inactivated by an approved method (e.g., autoclaving) or packaged for removal by regulated medical waste contractor Surface clean and disinfect all lab benches used for procedures with biohazards Surface clean and disinfect all biosafety cabinets (BSCs), clean benches, centrifuges, incubators, or other equipment used to process and store biohazards Remove or deface all biohazard labels/markings on decontaminated equipment Verify that all biohazard labels have been removed/defaced and remove the door placard(s) as necessary Chemicals Inspected Label all chemical containers with the proper chemical name Close all containers securely Dispose of empty containers in the trash after removing all markings and writing \"EMPTY\" on the container; triple rinse empty acid containers before disposal; do not dispose of any chemicals in the trash or down the drain, regardless of hazard rating.

Whether starting a lab from scratch or converting a garage or other space, there are some common infrastructure and design aspects that are important to keep in mind. First, before thinking about the inside of the lab, consider the outside and the building that will house the community lab. When searching for a location, consider the following: Zoning. City zoning laws specify how property in specific locations may be used. For example, city officials will define whether a particular area can be residential, commercial, or mixed-use. If the community lab is going to be used as a business, it will need to be located in a zone that allows for commercial use. Zoning may also affect where labs can be located, where externally vented chemical hoods can be used, etc. Contact the local public works office for more information. Neighborhood. Consider if the neighbors are biotech friendly ahead of time. Neighbors are an important part of the community and can be advocates for the organization. Get to know them and invite them to tour the facility and participate in educational opportunities. Also, consider who might be uncomfortable with a lab next door, such as restaurants. Make a point of establishing rapport with such businesses. Access. Consider whether the location is accessible by public transit and if parking is available. Also, consider local events, such as sporting matches, that may take place in the area. Additionally, consider access for persons with disabilities. Review the ADA's Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities for more information. Safety and security. Consider the safety of the area, surrounding lighting, and surveillance options if in a high crime area. Building infrastructure . Consider whether the building has a sprinkler system, a loading dock, or doors wide enough for large equipment such as a -80\u00b0C freezer or a biosafety cabinet to pass through. It is advisable to have more than one exit from the labspace. You'll need an available sink. Another consideration is power\u2014how many electrical outlets are available and what is the maximum load on the main breaker panel? Other considerations include: are there separate rooms you could rent out? Is there a kitchen area that is well-separated from the lab? Is there a large room outside the lab that can be used as a lecture area or classroom?","title":"Finding a Lab Location and Getting Started"},{"location":"Chapter%202/#environmental-and-health-considerations","text":"Once a space has been identified or inherited, consider the following environmental issues: Potentially contaminated sites. Before settling on a location, determine past uses of the land and the facility. Determine if hazardous materials still exist on the property. One way to do this in the U.S. is to visit the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website of known Superfund Sites or ToxMap http://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov . Asbestos. Asbestos is a natural mineral that is known to cause cancer if inhaled. Be aware that flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, pipe wrappings, and insulation may contain asbestos. Visit the U.S. EPA's asbestos website to learn more about asbestos and to find local vendors who can assist with asbestos remediation. Radioactivity . Radioactivity testing should be performed and decontaminated if discovered. Contact a radiation safety company to assess potential radiation contamination. Mercury. Mercury can be found in many products, such as thermometers, compact fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, manometers, and other pieces of scientific equipment. Be aware that mercury may be found in sink traps or under floor tiles if the space was ever previously used as a lab or was part of a production facility that used mercury. Visit the EPA's mercury website for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with mercury remediation. Lead and lead paint . Lead was banned from U.S. paint products in 1978 but may still be used in other countries. Buildings and structures with lead paint require special precautions, especially if the paint will be removed. You can buy community lead testing kits online or at your local home improvement store. Visit the EPA's lead website for more information and to find local vendors that can assist with lead remediation. Natural disaster zones . Consider the location of the community facility and whether it will be located in a flood , fire hazards, landslide, earthquake liquefaction, or other zone prone to natural disasters. Be aware that some insurance companies will not provide flood insurance to facilities in flood zones. Contact an insurance company to determine if the facility is in a flood zone.","title":"Environmental and Health Considerations"},{"location":"Chapter%202/#establishing-contact-with-local-agencies","text":"We recommend establishing rapport with key personnel at local fire departments, police precincts, and hospitals, so that if an incident does occur, first responders and police are familiar with your lab, its mission, and operations. Establishing such relationships could preempt misunderstandings about your lab's purpose, aid in the response to an incident, establish champions of the lab in the community, and help provide advice in lab safety and security and local ordinances. After establishing your lab, reach out to your local fire and police department before any potential incident. Invite them for a tour of the lab or to a community event to give them a sense of the lab facilities and activities. A few examples of local agencies to contact include: Local fire departments. In some areas, community labs may need a permit from the local fire department. Before building the lab, it is a good idea to contact the local fire department and find out about the local requirements. Typical fire codes set allowances on the amounts of hazardous chemicals in a building and can require additional fire protection (such as fire sprinklers) depending on the local zoning requirements, the materials used in the facility, and the materials used in the construction or renovation of the building. Contacting the fire department early in the process is helpful for identifying these requirements. Public Health Department. Inquire with the local Public Health Department to find out about health codes that pertain to labs or if there are reporting requirements in the event of an exposure or accident. In different localities, you may also be required to contact branches dedicated to the management of chemical and regulated medical waste. Local Chamber of Commerce or neighborhood association. Some community labs have successfully obtained support from their local chambers of commerce, which has more deeply integrated them into their communities. Consider asking chamber officials to visit your lab and inviting potential funding groups to tour when they visit your city. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or Local Law Enforcement Agencies. Many community labs have found it beneficial to establish relationships with agents at local FBI offices to identify and address any misconceptions of the nature of the research happening in the lab. For advice on how to reach out to the FBI, contact the heads of community labs in the U.S. (e.g., Biocurious, Genspace).","title":"Establishing Contact with Local Agencies"},{"location":"Chapter%202/#lab-infrastructure-and-design","text":"When setting up a community biology lab, consider the equipment and materials you will use and the basic infrastructure required to handle them. Whether setting up a space for the first time, moving to a new space, or settling into the space, consider the following list of recommendations for the infrastructure and design of a biology lab. Walls and floors. The lab walls, ceilings, and floors should be smooth, impermeable to liquids and easy to clean. Walls should be fire resistant with no carpet or flammable materials on the wall or barriers. Walls and entryways should separate the lab from non-lab areas. Floors should be slip-resistant, durable, and easily cleaned. Floors should not be carpeted because the fabric may absorb chemicals and dirt and is very difficult to clean. Chemicals that soak into carpet may also cause reactions long after the chemical spill. Carpet may also become a breeding ground for microbes. Benchtops . Benchtops should be impermeable to liquids, including disinfectants, and other chemicals such as acids and solvents. Benchtops should be resistant to scratches, impact, and heat. They should not have open seams and should be easy to clean and decontaminate. If your benchtops are wooden, or if only wood benches are available, make sure that they are sealed with an impermeable surface, such as a sealed tile or epoxy coating. Porous materials such as wood veneer products should be avoided as they will absorb chemicals and water and will weaken over time. Wood-grain plastic laminate or phenolic resin may provide an acceptable alternative. Previously used stainless steel food preparation tables (shown below) may be purchased and make wonderful lab benches (30 inch x 60 inch tables are approximately $130 new). Furniture stores, such as Ikea, sell tempered glass and all-metal tables, but be wary of fiberboard or laminate filled products. Sink . A sink for handwashing,dishwashing, and for disposal of non-toxic and non-hazardous liquids should be provided. Sinks should be located near the exit door. If this is not possible, ensure the sink is located as close to the lab as possible. A gooseneck or adjustable faucet and deep pan sink are highly recommended. Many stainless steel sinks from restaurants going out of business are available from auction sales and make wonderful lab sinks. A dish rack for drying glassware that drains into the sink is also helpful. The sink should never be located in an area that is used for food preparation. If running water is not available, containers of water and hand sanitizer must be available. A portable handwashing station with clean and dirty water containers may be an acceptable solution as long as it is emptied and refilled on a regular basis. Lab furniture. Chairs and stools should be non-porous and easily cleaned. Chairs made of vinyl, hard plastic, and hard rubber make good choices. Plastic coverings that can be easily cleaned may be used to cover cloth chairs. Benches and other lab furniture, such as shelving and cabinets, should be of a sturdy design and material to support equipment and storage items. The U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) lab Design Requirements Manual (DRM) specifies that shelves should be able to hold 50 pounds per linear foot for 1 foot deep shelves. It is recommended that countertops be able to hold no less than 50 pounds per square foot. Shelving with adjustable height shelves are recommended. If located in a seismically active area, restraints and anchorage for shelving and cabinets may be necessary and is often required by local building codes. Storage space . Community labs often get their supplies and equipment from donations, auctions, or discount sales. It is important to have adequate storage space for and consider storage requirements for frequently accessed items as well as \"deep storage\" for less frequently used items. We recommend creating clearly labeled storage spaces inside and outside the lab and discouraging clutter on benchtops or in aisles. Make it easy to see what is stored where: consider using well-labeled and transparent boxes to easily see the contents. PPE storage space . Storage space for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as lab coats, gloves, and goggles, should be available throughout the lab. Make sure that any workstation or equipment that requires PPE is labeled with a sign. PPE should be stationed at the lab entrance with signage and available to visitors to the space. Personal storage space . Non-lab items such as coats and bags should be stored outside the lab (e.g., on coat racks, hooks, cubbies, closet). Personal or project storage space on shelves and in fridges or freezers is usually allowed at the discretion of lab management. All items should be clearly labeled with the owner's name and the contents. Office space . Demarcate space for eating, drinking, class, or office work that is outside the lab. Check local zoning requirements to determine if labs and offices must be physically separated. Lighting. The lab should have adequate lighting for work at all times during the day. We recommend providing task lighting at the bench or directly by work areas if possible. Reflections and glare should be avoided. Areas containing equipment with ultraviolet (UV) lighting should be limited to those doing work when UV lamps are on, which should only be as necessary. When possible, use a self-timing light switch in rooms that are seldom used as the switches can save a significant amount of money. It is also a good idea to have access to emergency lighting, such as a flashlight, in the case of an electrical outage. Glow-in-the-dark signs can be used to guide lab users to the flashlight and other safety equipment. Doors. If possible, doors to the lab should have vision panels, be self-closing, and have the appropriate fire rating . Locking doors with restricted access is important for the prevention of theft, as well as for the physical safety of the lab users. Always ensure that the doors have the proper emergency egress opening direction and are outfitted with panic bars or emergency door release buttons if necessary (check your local fire department). Consider egress routes in the event of an emergency. It is advisable to have two exits from the lab. Electricity. Biolabs tend to require greater electrical loads than commercial office spaces. You can estimate the loads you need by adding up the wattage used by individual pieces in the lab. Be sure to tally continuously-on loads (such as fridges and freezers) versus peak loads (such as autoclaves or large centrifuges). You can also do load testing to identify your power needs. All electrical work should be up to code. Make sure the breaker panel is carefully labeled with what circuits or equipment each breaker powers, so they can be safely deactivated in case of emergency. It may be useful to also label each outlet with the number of the breaker that powers it. Check that all power cords are in good condition (especially with older second-hand equipment) and rated for the amperage of the equipment (see Chapter 9 - Equipment Usage/Safety ). Many labs start small and grow over time, so it is important to anticipate a higher energy load in the long term. Make sure power is available away from wall sockets. Power drops from the ceiling are not expensive and may save lab personnel from daisy-chaining power cords (which are trip and fire hazards and are likely to violate fire ordinances). Temperature and energy input monitors on important equipment (such as ultra-low temperature freezers) can provide early warning before equipment failures. If possible, it is desirable to have a generator for use with essential equipment like incubators and freezers incase of an electrical outage. Electrical safety devices . Labs should have Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI) in the electrical receptacles in order to minimize the risks associated with electrical equipment (e.g., shock, electrocution). The GFCI should be tested at least once a year, because they can corrode or become damaged. Learn how to perform a test here . Eyewash and shower . We recommend providing access to an eyewash station, which may also be required by safety regulations. Eyewashes can be plumbed in or you can buy single-use squirt bottles with sterile saline solution (don't worry they're cheap!). Remember that: Eyewash stations have a limited lifetime and need to be replaced; set calendar reminders to do so. Fixed eyewash stations should be flushed monthly or per local regulations. Emergency showers are typically only required if lab users will be exposed to \"injurious corrosive materials\" ( ANSI 358.1) . Refer to the international standard ANSI 358.1 for additional recommendations for eyewashes and shower equipment. Fire safety equipment. Fire extinguishers and smoke detectors are often legally required. It is also advisable (and often required) for the lab to have sprinklers and a fire alarm. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes require labs to carry fire suppression equipment such as fire extinguishers and fire sprinkler heads. Fire extinguishers should use carbon dioxide or dry chemical (type A-B-C extinguishers) to put out fires. Water is not a good option for labs. If you use combustible metals such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium, consider Type D fire extinguishers, which also use a dry chemical but dispense it more gently. If you plan to work with highly flammable materials, first consult with your local fire department. We also recommend keeping a fire blanket on hand. Local fire departments and fire service companies may inspect and fill fire extinguishers and offer free training on their use. Fire extinguishers must be inspected by a certified inspector annually. Refer to Chapter 6 Emergency Procedures for more information on Fire Safety. Ventilation . If building a lab, consideration should be given to installing a ventilation system that provides inward airflow without recirculation. Many community labs moving into existing buildings will not have that option but heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals may be able to balance the air in the lab to create a small negative pressure. If mechanical ventilation is not available, windows can be opened but should be fitted with screens to prevent insects from entering the space. If you're able to design the lab, ensure it has separate air handling units for offices, bathrooms, and other spaces. Chemical fume hoods and biological safety cabinets may require their own ventilation and space considerations.","title":"Lab Infrastructure and Design"},{"location":"Chapter%202/#signage","text":"The lab is often full of signs, which is a good thing and important for the safety of users. Many signs tend to go unnoticed by very regular users of the lab. That said, signs serve as useful reminders and are especially important for new users and for emergency responders to the lab. Signs also instruct users where things are and help them understand the lab rules (see some example signs from BioCurious ). Signage that indicates who to contact and what to do in an emergency should be posted in conspicuous locations throughout the building.

This could include materials such as blood samples or primary human cell lines. High voltage. The high voltage warning symbol, which includes a lightning bolt arrow in a yellow triangle, warns of voltage high enough to cause serious injury or death. If working with high voltage, consider using an isolation transformer and other appropriate high-voltage safeguards and PPE. You can find guidance on this topic elsewhere\u2014this handbook focuses primarily on biological and chemical safety.

Some signs will be required by law in certain places but not others so check local requirements. Etiquette Reminders No eating/drinking. Inform lab members that eating and/or drinking where hazardous materials are used, handled, or stored is not permitted. Eating and drinking may result in the accidental ingestion of hazardous materials, and food and beverages could also contaminate your lab experiments. Food or drink containers and utensils should not be stored, washed, or dried in the lab. Refrigerators used for storage of research materials must not be used for storage of food or beverages.

Label storage areas clearly so that chemicals can easily be put back in the same location they were taken from. Include signs pointing out the location of and instructions for how to handle chemical spills . Refer to Chapter 10 - Chemical Safety for more details on chemical safety, storage, and signage. PPE Reminder Signage Post signage in areas where extreme heat or cold is located. Always wear heat-resistant gloves for handling items coming out of the autoclave or microwave, as well as reminders for handling cold items with protective gloves. Incompatible glove signage should also be posted at corrosive cabinets or chemical fume hoods as a reminder. Reminders should be posted that describe when it is and isn't appropriate to wear PPE, such as signs on exit doors reminding people to remove lab coats and gloves before leaving the lab. Emergency Contact Information Provide contact information for each of the following: The lab manager(s), staff, or volunteers in charge. Any building personnel that can be reached in an emergency. Local fire department. Local police department. 911, or country equivalent, emergency response number. For freezer emergencies, you may also want to post the nearest locations that sell dry ice.","title":""},{"location":"Chapter%202/#types-of-labs-and-specific-considerations","text":"This section provides special guidance for different types of community lab facilities. Rented Dedicated Lab Space. A number of community labs rent dedicated space from a commercial landlord. It's important to know the zoning for such a space (usually biology labs require industrial or mixed-use zoning but as with everything it depends on local laws). It is your responsibility to make sure that your landlord has a clear understanding of the types of activities at your lab, your users, power usage, policies, and hours. The more the landlord knows at the outset, the smoother your relationship will be, and the less potential for conflict in the case of an incident. We recommend occasionally inviting the landlord into the lab as a way to establish a good working relationship. Kitchen or Other Home Lab. The most challenging aspect of the design of a home lab is the separation of the lab space from the living space. It is important not to eat or drink in the space where work is being performed. Avoid setting up a lab on carpeted flooring and make sure that walls and furniture are impermeable (or cover them with plastic tarp). Small dorm fridges and freezers can be bought cheaply second-hand in any college town. If you have roommates or family members who share the space, you may want to mark off the space and establish an understanding about access and safety in the lab. Basement or Garage Lab. Paying attention to the airflow in a garage or basement lab is critical. Too much airflow may increase chances for sample contamination, but too little may not provide adequate ventilation for users. Moisture and mold may also be an issue\u2014you can check mold levels using a simple petri dish kit available at many home improvement stores. Makerspace (Conjoined or Mixed Use). Separation of spaces to reduce dust and vibration is important in a biolab within a makerspace. It's essential to protect the bio area from other makerspace members who may not appreciate the special needs of a biolab. Chemicals and biologicals should be stored in cabinets away from the shared space. Library. Separate porous library books from lab space. University Spaces. Be aware of rules and regulations of the host institution and incorporate them into the policies of your own lab space. We also recommend scheduling regular check-ins with the management of the host institution and outreach events for your neighbors. Be sure to mark off the lab from other spaces in the host facility with lockable doors and clear signage. Mobile Lab (e.g., a Van or a Container). Mobile labs come with special considerations about establishing resilient containment practices for chemicals and organisms. Accidental environmental releases or spills are especially a concern with mobile units that could be involved in traffic accidents. Contact your local Department of Motor Vehicles or equivalent governing institution for proper signage and containment procedures for these units.","title":"Types of Labs and Specific Considerations"},{"location":"Chapter%202/#opening-the-lab","text":"Before work commences, it is a good idea to review the experimental setup to check for any missing items that will help ensure a safe lab experience for users.

This shift helps to democratize access to science. It also teaches responsible community behavior such as working alongside other lab members and collaboration. Consider reading \"At the Bench: A Laboratory Navigator\" by Kathy Barker for more information. It is a great guide for lab members and managers that provides answers to difficult questions about lab safety and procedures. Basic Training Required to Work at a Community Lab We recommend that labs offer orientation and training programs to help users get familiar with the space, equipment, protocols, and safety procedures. Offer an entry program that helps people get used to working in the lab that is general and offers simple introductions to the resources, safety equipment, and fire extinguishers. This can be followed by more specific trainings for delicate, hazardous, or expensive equipment and procedures. Suggested Minimum Training Emergency procedures, exits, fire extinguishers, emergency contacts Lab hygiene, chemical and biological spills, clean up Lab clothing Lab equipment safety guidelines Certification on restricted equipment Community code of conduct Waste disposal Project-specific safety information based on project review (e.g., chemical or biological specific info) Lab Etiquette Lab etiquette is essential for working in a shared space. It is a vital way to ensure that the workload does not grow unmanageable as the membership expands. Because members share the same lab benches, materials, and equipment, it's important to set expectations about cleanliness, equipment usage, and sharing policies. Lab etiquette is an extension of a lab's \"Code of Conduct.\" A Code of Conduct establishes behavioral norms and is a social contract between the organization and its members (For examples of Codes of Conduct, see Lab Management Practices ). Lab etiquette covers more of the particulars on how the lab operates and how to be a good lab user. It covers simple tasks: washing dishes, cleaning up the work area, expectations on equipment usage, labeling, and communication. | BOX: Examples of poor lab etiquette include: Borrowing buffers or solutions without asking permission: put contact information on buffers so users can call the owner of them and ask. If problems continue, lab management may need to check access records to identify persistent offenders. Monopolizing equipment: add a note to let other users know when the experiment will end, where the sample can be stored, or how to contact the owner. When starting the autoclave, ask if anyone else has some materials to add. State clearly how long materials may be left in a device and what happens to them when they are removed. Taking incubations out even when they are on hold: provide signage that provides directions about what to do and how to tell if the equipment is on hold; provide an \"in usedo not remove\" tag, along with \"your materials were removed after X days of inactivity.\" Moving materials in storage locations: everyone must label their materials and provide signs about what is shared and what is not. Poor care of shared resources (e.g., leaving open, empty, wasting supplies): provide signs with guidance and emphasize expectations during training. Taking up too much space in a shared storage space: Some labs give out \"parking tickets\" for leaving materials unclaimed or unlabelled items out. Ensure that a process for disposing unclaimed materials is written into the membership agreement. Overusing shared supplies: provide signage to direct people about the reasonable use of supplies. Set expectations during lab inductions of when users should consider buying their own supplies. | | --- | Basic Hygiene for Lab Many community lab directors have reported increased productivity, community engagement, and general happiness when spaces are clean and organized. Simple things like clear counters, empty sinks, uncluttered hallways, and organized storage make a good and safe workplace. We recommend developing and documenting lab decontamination practices. If used appropriately, these procedures will become routine. For example, lab benches and other surfaces should be cleaned and decontaminated before and after every use, and lab benches should be cleared of any unnecessary equipment. Some labs experiment with demarcating areas for pieces of equipment with bright electrical tape or by other means so it is clear when items have not been returned. Lab Security (Doors, Instruments, Keys, Hours) Labs should offer guidance on signing and signing out of the space. Procedures should include: Building access Key holder procedure (who holds physical keys) Hours of operation Sign-ins for all users (members, staff and guests) Tours Access to lab Specific lab areas High-value equipment Off hours (e.g., working alone in the lab) We recommend having locked access to the space and a sign-in/sign-out protocol. These procedures help with overall safety/security, understanding the general use of the space, and enable the collection of metrics that can be used when developing grants and public funding. It also helps when there is an emergency, stolen or damaged equipment, or if lights are left on. The sign-in process can be simple. It can simply be a piece of paper with a waiver attached at the top of the page (see example table below): Example Sign-in Sheet Community Labs Sign In/Waiver Agreements Name Member / Guest / Staff Time In / Out More complex sign-in sheets can have tablets synced to a member database allowing members to electronically sign membership agreements. This can be tied to an RFID system as well. If the member has all of the safety requirements, they are permitted entry into the space or use of equipment. Community labs with staff or volunteers who are often in the space can ask that they remind people upon entering the space to sign in. Access to Specific Equipment We suggest labs restrict access to high-value or dangerous equipment. High-value equipment is difficult to find and most likely very expensive to repair if broken. There are several ways to restrict access: move the equipment to a separate room; remove and lock away key parts without which the equipment will not function, like expensive microscope objectives or sample input pumps; place lockout tags on pressure regulators; install access or power cord locks. RFID lockout solutions are commercially available but expensive. Emergency Exits A map of the emergency exits should be posted in highly visible public areas, along with the location of flammable cabinets, compressed gas cylinder, and other fire hazards. The leasing agent or landlord of the space should be able to provide a general building plan and map of the area for customization. This plan will help members and emergency responders know how to evacuate and either avoid or address hazards in the case of fire. Working Alone in the Lab A policy should be implemented to allow the use of the facility in the evenings, weekends, and unusual working hours. Many experiments do not follow normal business hours. As such, neither do accidents. Here are some policies for labs whose users work in the facility alone: All users should be required to fill out an emergency contact form. Have members read and acknowledge a lone working policy including the dangers of working alone. Quiz them on emergency procedures. Create a policy where lone users must inform another person that they are working in the lab alone. Ensure that the sign-in and sign-out procedure is followed. Consider if there are any times where special permission should be sought or restrictions imposed when members work in the lab overnight or with dangerous chemicals. Include as part of projects risk assessments a section detailing what procedures safe hours or experiments that should not undertaken alone. Consider recording members' hours through RFID cards used to access the lab. Video cameras might also be installed for both safety and security reasons, but be mindful of privacy concerns and data protection regulations in your area. We recommend that individuals under the age of 18 never work alone in the lab. A parent, guardian, or mentor should be the responsible party and must be with them at all times, without exception. See Chapter 2 - Lab Management Practices for more recommendations on setting youth policies in your lab. Basic Clothing and Footwear Lab coats should be available for users along with other PPE such as gloves and safety glasses. There are additional basic clothing, footwear, and other considerations to take into account while working in the lab. Clothes should not be at risk of dangling in chemicals, biological cultures, or of easily catching on fire. Clothing should cover the skin (e.g., no shorts or short skirts). No shoes with exposed skin or high-heeled shoes. Long hair should be tied back. No long or dangling jewelry, bracelets, or scarves, which could get tangled in moving parts or snagged on items in the lab. Remove rings that could puncture gloves. Be prepared to ask people to change into clothes that are more suitable for work in the lab if they arrive in unsuitable attire. Consider providing hair ties and foot covers (booties). Remember that users will not necessarily know all of the dangers in the lab, so reminding them before activities such as workshops and posting a clothing and PPE policy in a visible place is important. For more information on clothing and PPE, see Chapter 8 - Personal Protective Equipment . Food, Beverages, Application of Makeup, or Contact Lenses in the Lab Community labs should apply a strict policy that no food, beverages, or gum be allowed in the lab because of the risk that food or drinks could become cross-contaminated and then be ingested. If food and drink are allowed in areas outside the lab, consider providing a separate fridge and sink. Similarly, the application of contact lenses or makeup should also be banned from the lab to avoid cross-contaminated with chemicals or organisms. Housekeeping Paying for a professional biowaste pickup service is a valuable investment in the biosafety of your space (see Waste DIsposal ). Holding occasional cleaning parties (in conjunction with an event) can be useful for tidying the lab. If the lab can afford to pay for general housekeeping for bathrooms and common areas, we recommend considering this as it is usually not too expensive and can really make the space tidier. Trash, Clean Lab Benches, Cleaning Up Spills Volunteers and members should be trained in trash and general cleanup techniques. Cleanup can also be a regular part of classes. Cleaning Up Spills A chemical and biological spill kit should be readily available in your lab. They do not have to be complex for most spills, but they can help greatly in preventing a spill from reaching a floor drain. Uline and PIG sell good basic kits, but you can more cheaply assemble your own kit. See Emergency Procedures for more information on spill kits dealing with spills. Signage and Labeling Signs and labels are essential components of lab safety. Basics that should be labeled: Storage locations Emergency contact information Instructions for cleaning Contact information for questions on machine operation Contact information for safety questions Special equipment warnings (e.g., hot surface, under pressure, close valve when finished, laser in use, before using this equipment you must pass training) Warnings about the building or structure Emergency exits Emergency equipment (e.g., electrocution hazard, fire extinguisher) All chemicals and biological materials should be labeled, along with every derivative. Please refer to the section on labeling in Chapter 10 - Chemical Safety and Chapter 13 - Biological Safety for more information. Emergency Response We recommend having well-documented emergency response procedures and making sure that all members are familiar with them. Ensure that emergency contact information is clearly displayed in the space along with non-emergency numbers and email addresses for issues like blown fuses, broken lights, suspicious people, or unusual smells.

The first iteration of a code of conduct was developed in 2011 when there were only a handful of community laboratories (see below). It was They were a starting point, enabling each community lab or DIYbio group to adapt and evolve the codem over time. As the community has grown, the codes have grown with it. In 2019, the Global Community Biosummit developed and agreed to by consensus a community ethics document thatcommunity labs should incorporate into their own practices and continue to evolve over time . Human Subjects and Responsible Research (Including Public Outreach) When conducting sponsored human subjects research at institutions (e.g., universities) you often must receive institutional approval prior to starting. In the U.S., this is typically done through the university Institutional Review Board (IRB), and private for-hire IRB's exist for research conducted outside universities. Similar systems exist outside the U.S. The IRB's role is to advocate for and protect human subjects who participate in research by reviewing research proposals and methods with a lens towards ethics, legal compliance, and social justice. In many instances, this type of review is required by the sponsor of the research, and many journals will not publish work that has not been reviewed/approved by such a review board. Research ethics and its regulations will vary from country to country and you should investigate what specific rules/regulations might cover your experiments and public outreach events. It's important to remember that many of the outreach activities described in this chapter may require certain approvals or consent from individuals before they can participate. When designing/conducting your public outreach events, group projects and/or educational activities, consider issues such as informed voluntary participation, confidentiality, anonymity, and minimising harm. While most public outreach activities a community lab conducts areis not subject to human subjects research or similar type of approvals, we recommend that you think about developing a review process and consent form to both protect your lab from liabilities but more importantly to maintain ethical research practices. _If you are collecting data (including spit) from a minor, you will need to obtain consent from their legal guardian(s)._The iGEM Human Practices page is a useful resource, and we have reproduced some of that information below. An informed consent form should address the following key points: What information is being collected? Who is collecting it? You will want to provide contact details for your lab. How is it being collected? Why is it being collected? How will it be used? Who will it be shared with? What measures will be taken to ensure the participants' privacy and confidentiality? How will participating affect the individuals concerned? You should present in clear and plain language that: Their participation is voluntary. They have the right to terminate their participation at any point of the data collection process without any adverse consequences. For most projects you could simply ask for a verbal consent, but depending on the type of project and data you might collect (DNA, etc.), you may want to have a signed consent form. Either way a participant must confirm that: They have had the chance to ask any questions regarding the project. They understand that their participation is voluntary and that they could terminate their contribution at any time without consequences. They agree to participate in the study and (if applicable) they agree to be recorded. If you plan on publishing your work you may be required to follow additional specific research ethics guidelines. We recommend you anonymise any data if you plan on publishing your work both on- and offline, unless specific permission to use their name has been obtained. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance The iGEM Human Practices wiki is a great resource explaining the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) , as well as other information regarding research ethics. We have reproduced iGEM's guidance (in part) here: Since May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been enforced by the European Union (EU), which has a global effect. This law gives EU citizens more control over their data. You may find that GDPR requirements largely mirror a general norm of good practice in research data protection in different regions. However, it is important to highlight that the GDPR is wider in scope. You should familiarize yourself with the GDPR if you are conducting outreach experiments relating to citizens of the EU. Serious violations of the GDPR may lead to penalties. The Scope of GDPR The GDPR applies to \"personal data\" and \"special category personal data.\" Personal data is data about living people from which they can be identified, either directly or indirectly. Examples of personal data include name, location data, an online identifier, or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that person. We want to draw your attention to the fact that personal data that has been 'pseudonymised' can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual. Special category personal data refers to sensitive personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a person, data concerning health, or other biological characteristics. The GDPR prescribes 7 principles relating to the processing of personal data. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency : Data should be processed lawfully, fairly, and with the data subject's (e.g., your interviewees' or survey participants') full knowledge and consent. (Please read the Informed Consent section.) Purpose limitation : Data should be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and only used for these purposes. Data minimisation : Data should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of your project. Accuracy : Data should be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; Inaccurate data, once detected, should be erased or rectified without delay. Storage limitation : Data you collected can be stored for a period after the Jamboree to allow traceability (e.g., we recommend no longer than 6 months), after which personal data should be safely destroyed or deleted. Integrity and confidentiality : Data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data. For example, data collected from interviews or focus groups studies should be stored in a password protected computer which protects against unauthorised or unlawful access. Appropriate measures, such as a password-protected backup drive, should also be implemented to protect against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Accountability : This principle requires you to take responsibility for what you do with personal data and how you comply with the other principles. You must have appropriate measures and records (e.g., signed informed consent) in place to demonstrate your compliance. Special category personal data : In addition to the above 7 principles, if you are collecting and processing special category personal data, extra oversight is required to ensure the necessity and legitimacy of your planned data collection and that all data will be properly protected. To demonstrate your compliance, you will need to have the following: Institutional Research Ethics Committee review and approval Data minimisation and minimisation of recruitment numbers Anonymisation and other technical safeguards against accidental disclosure and loss or corruption of research data Institutional Research Ethics Committee review and approval Depending on the nature of sensitive data you collect, you may also need additional governance checks (including Health Research Authority assessment for health research). While we recognize that most community labs will not have institutional resources to assist them in navigating GDPR issues, we recommend consulting with a local institutional administration official for guidance whenever possible. Human Subjects Research and Other Activities Involving the Public There are many ways that you need to be careful with how you interact with humans in your project even if you are not collecting or experimenting with biomedical samples from humans. iGEM teams often engage with communities to understand broader social concerns, much of which involves talking with people, collecting information, analyzing it, and presenting it before judges at the Jamboree and on your wikis. This type of human subjects research is social science research. In many cases social science research (such as surveys and data collection from interviews) requires pre-approval from review boards at your local institution and must comply with national guidelines. This oversight is designed to ensure ethical conduct, including issues such as privacy, voluntary participation, informed consent, and protection of vulnerable populations. It is iGEM's policy that all human subjects research conducted by teams must be done in accordance with that team's institutional and national guidelines, and teams must demonstrate their awareness of these guidelines and their adherence to them. Teams are reminded they must attest to compliance via their safety forms. Copies of national guidelines, for many countries, may be found here . Many universities have an internal \"Institutional Review Board\" (IRB) or \"Research Ethics Committee\" (REC) that is responsible for approving human subjects research at that institution. Because of the time it can take to fill out forms and receive IRB/REC approval (often weeks or months), teams are strongly advised to begin the approval process as soon as possible. Demonstration of adherence to institutional policies should be seen as minimum requirements, and we expect teams to go above and beyond in demonstrating their commitments to responsible and ethical conduct. For example, for teams that do not have established review committees at their institutions (e.g., some community lab teams), we expect them to consult with the international and national policies and other resources and experts linked on the Safety Hub and Human Practices Hub (see the How to Succeed section of the Hub).","title":"Chapter 4"},{"location":"Chapter%204/#codes-of-conduct-human-subjects-and-data-protection","text":"","title":"Codes of Conduct, Human Subjects, and Data Protection"},{"location":"Chapter%204/#codes-of-conduct","text":"From its earliest beginnings the DIYbio community has incorporated safety, security, and responsible conduct into its ethical principles.
