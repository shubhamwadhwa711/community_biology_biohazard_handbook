<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Animals are an entire kingdom of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)">Tree of Life</a> covering a very broad range of organisms of differing sizes, with different care requirements and safety considerations. However, only a small range of species are typically used as model organisms in biology. Two common species likely to be found in community labs are the common fruit fly (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>) and nematode worms (<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>). This chapter offers specific advice on common types of lab animals used in community labs along with general safety tips.</p>
<p>Animal-based research presents unique hazards and should always adhere to basic <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/">biological safety</a> principles and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cX4LtgbT5ylLNfsx2jk8wZep-J5tXrrLug_i4UI8oE8/">risk assessment</a> procedures. For example, animals may bite, scratch, sting, cause allergic reactions and/or harbor infectious diseases. The fact that animals are mobile and may swim, walk or fly presents special containment challenges compared to the limited motility of most microbes and plants. In addition, for some animal species and particularly vertebrates, there exist unique legal and ethical considerations that are not invoked for research with other organisms.</p>
<h2 id="ethics-of-animal-use">Ethics of Animal Use</h2>
<p>Most countries have animal research ethics guidelines or legislation to regulate the scientific use of vertebrates (e.g., fish, mammals, birds). For example, the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/animalresearch/legislation/legislation.aspx">UK&#39;s Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act</a> regulates &quot;any experimental or other scientific procedure...which may have the effect of causing that animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.&quot;</p>
<p>Some countries also include cephalopods (e.g., cuttlefish, octopus) and decapod crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, and prawns). The rationale for this inclusion is that all vertebrates and many invertebrates possess the neurophysiological components necessary to receive, transmit, process, and remember painful stimuli (<a href="http://nuffieldbioethics.org/wp-content/uploads/The-ethics-of-research-involving-animals-full-report.pdf">The Ethics of Research Involving Animals</a>).</p>
<p>Some important ethical considerations include the welfare of animals through good husbandry practices and minimization of pain through use of anesthesia during any experimental procedures and humane methods of euthanasia. While most animal research legislation does not extend to insects (with exceptions for bees) or other less complex invertebrate animals; it is good practice that they are also reared and maintained with care and anesthetized or euthanized prior to invasive procedures.</p>
<p>There are numerous guides for the ethical use of animals in research, including the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54045/">2011 National Academics Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</a> and the <a href="https://nabt.org/files/galleries/Principles_and_Guidelines_for_the_Use_of_Animals_in_Precollege_Education.pdf">2006 National Academies Guide to Principles and Guidelines for the Use of Animals in</a><a href="https://nabt.org/files/galleries/Principles_and_Guidelines_for_the_Use_of_Animals_in_Precollege_Education.pdf">Precollege</a><a href="https://nabt.org/files/galleries/Principles_and_Guidelines_for_the_Use_of_Animals_in_Precollege_Education.pdf">Education</a>. The latter includes ten principles that we have adapted for community labs.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1:</strong> When an intrusive study of a living organism is deemed appropriate, first consider using plants or invertebrates with no, minimal, or primitive nervous systems. Intrusive studies of vertebrates and invertebrates with advanced nervous systems should be conducted only when absolutely necessary for the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2:</strong> Supervision must be provided by individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced with the health, husbandry, care, and handling of the animal species used and who understand applicable laws, regulations, policies, and ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3:</strong> Appropriate care for animals must be provided, including appropriate food, water, housing, temperature, and lighting.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4:</strong> Animals should be healthy and free of diseases that can be transmitted to humans or to other animals unless required for the experiment. Veterinary care must be provided as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 5:</strong> Lab members must report all scratches, bites, and other injuries, allergies, or illnesses immediately to the community lab Safety Team.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 6:</strong> Lab members must not conduct experimental procedures on regulated animals that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are likely to cause pain, discomfort, or interfere with an animal&#39;s health or well-being (note that procedures that cause pain in humans are considered to cause pain in other vertebrates).</li>
<li>Induce nutritional deficiencies or toxicities.</li>
<li>Expose animals to microorganisms, ionizing radiation, cancer-producing agents, or any other harmful drugs or chemicals capable of causing disease, injury, or birth defects in humans or animals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principle 7:</strong> Behavioral conditioning studies should not involve unpleasant stimuli wherever possible. In studies using positive reinforcement, animals should not be deprived of water. Food deprivation intervals should be appropriate for the species.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 8:</strong> A written plan for conducting an experiment with living animals must be prepared and approved by the community lab Safety Team prior to initiating the experiment or to obtaining the animals. If your community lab is housed in a university or research institution, projects will need to be reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The plan should include a justification for the use of the species and consideration of why a less complex organism was not appropriate.</p>
<p>We recommend including in your committee someone with experience on an institutional review board or ethics committee in an organization that reviews animal research, a veterinaria, or lay members drawn from the local community who have had ethics training. Some examples of ethics training resources include: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-animal-ethics-2">Animal Ethic Training</a>, <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/air/training_events.htm">NIH ethics training</a>, and <a href="https://www.apa.org/research/responsible/care-video">Care Video Series</a>.</p>
<h2 id="risk-assessment-and-training">Risk Assessment and Training</h2>
<p>Here are five questions to ask before starting to work with a particular animal in the lab:</p>
<p><strong>Do You Need to Use Live Animals?</strong></p>
<p>When considering the use of animals in research and particularly vertebrates and cephalopods, we recommend that you consider the three R&#39;s rules (reduction, replacement, and refinement). This involves ensuring that the number of animals used in the experiments is necessary (reduction), considering alternatives to live animals in experiments (replacement), and adopting experimental methods that minimize distress to the animals (refinement). Live animals should only be used when there are no viable alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Is It a Vertebrate or Invertebrate?</strong></p>
<p>In most countries, the use of vertebrates (animals with backbones, such as mice and fish) for research, teaching, or testing using procedures that may cause adverse effects such as &quot;pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm,&quot; is subject to legal restrictions and regulations. In many cases this requires a license for both the lab and the researcher. The use of mammals (e.g., mice, rats) is not recommended in community labs, and any use of vertebrate animals should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Most invertebrates are typically not covered by animal research regulations but in some regions (e.g., the EU), cephalopods, such as octopus, are covered. Community labs should carefully plan for the welfare and humane treatment of any cephalopods or other invertebrates used in their activities.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Animal Harbor Human or Animal Disease?</strong></p>
<p>Many animals, such as mosquitoes or ticks, provide reservoirs for human disease or can transmit infectious agents that may affect humans and other species (referred to as zoonoses). Higher levels of containment is required for these types of species. In general, the biosafety level recommended for working with infectious agents in animals is the same as that for working with the agents themselves (typically BSL-2 or higher). Therefore, if your lab conforms to BSL-2 and the potential pathogens from a particular species are also classified as BSL-2, then it may be possible to use the animals, subject to a full risk assessment and appropriate controls being put in place.</p>
<p>We strongly discourage community labs from using animals capable of harboring human or zoonotic disease. Risks of disease transmission should also be considered for insects or other wild animals collected from the wild or for ecological work.</p>
<p><strong>Is It Native to the Local Area?</strong></p>
<p>Use of &quot;alien&quot; or &quot;exotic&quot; animals and potentially invasive species that are not native to the local area must be avoided. Always consider containment measures for this purpose and ensure that animals cultured in the lab are not on local invasive species lists. Note that these species, along with others such as threatened and endangered species, will typically also be subject to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#heading=h.lcn700cgbm4u">import and transport controls</a>. In the U.S., the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">Department of Agriculture</a>, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/">Animal and Plant Health Inspection</a>, <a href="https://www.fws.gov/">Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, among others, monitor invasive and imported species. There are also different rules at the state and federal level.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Animal Genetically Modified or Will It Be Genetically Modified?</strong></p>
<p>Wild-type animals are generally not subject to containment or disposal regulations as long as they are indigenous to the local area. However, genetically modified (or GM) animals should always be contained and properly disposed. In many cases, measures will be the same as for microbes, requiring lab containment, then killing the organism and chemically deactivating or autoclaving prior to disposal. The major difference is the increased mobility of animals that may require further engineering containment controls (e.g., screens and fly traps to avoid escaped GM <em>Drosophila</em> flying out of the lab). A comprehensive guide to risk assessment for GM animals can be found in the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part5.pdf">SACGM Chapter 5</a>. For work in the U.S., see the <a href="https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/NIH_Guidelines.pdf">NIH Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Are There Any Other Risks Associated with the Animal?</strong></p>
<p>These could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stinging, biting, and scratching.</li>
<li>Toxin production.</li>
<li>Several arthropods and marine creatures produce toxins (e.g., centipedes, caterpillars, sea anemones).</li>
<li>Using these animals requires careful consideration of handling and risk to experimenters from both the live animal and any samples collected from them.</li>
<li>Feces or fecal pellets. Scat and feces from animals can carry infectious diseases to humans. The fecal matter should be handled and disposed of properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="animal-containment">Animal Containment</h2>
<p>Containment measures should be considered by asking two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What happens if the animal escapes?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What can be done to minimize the risk of the animal escaping?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Animal Containment Levels (ACLs) generally map onto the standard <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSWb9wwbvD1NAk0J06eCeqga5SHmuCkdpAMwJMxiLbk/">Biosafety Levels</a>. The following questions are designed for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694736">arthropod research</a> (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694736">Arthropod Containment Guidelines, Version 3.2</a>, American Committee Of Medical Entomology), but they provide a good starting point for assessing all animal containment requirements. The <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/gmo/acgm/acgmcomp/part5.pdf">UK SACGM Chapter 5</a> also offers comprehensive guidelines for risk assessment and containment of GM animals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the species already established in the local area?</li>
<li>If the species is alien to the area, is it likely that it would become established in the event of accidental escape? If the climate and locally available food is incompatible then the risk is low, such as tropical mosquitoes accidentally being released in a temperate winter.</li>
<li>Could an escape be controlled by common methods or does the species have a known or characterized resistance to those methods (e.g., insecticide resistance).</li>
<li>Does the species transmit any infectious agents and are those infectious agents likely to be present in the local environment (e.g., does an animal reservoir for a known zoonosis exist locally)?</li>
<li>Would accidental release of the arthropod significantly increase any public health risk to humans and animals?</li>
<li>Does the species have an enhanced ability compared to local populations to transmit infectious agents or cause harm?</li>
<li>Are strains available that have been genetically disabled to limit their viability outside of the lab (e.g., wingless or cold sensitive)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the organism can transmit diseases and its infection status is unknown (e.g., it was collected from the wild), further risk assessment should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is an infectious agent suspected? How likely is it? Many arboviruses are present at very low levels in arthropod populations (e.g., one in a thousand individuals carries the virus and even then, the potential dose may be too small to generate a viable infection).</li>
<li>What route of transmission is indicated? Is there horizontal or vertical transfer? The risk from processed samples may be very low compared to being bitten and certain life stages may not carry disease.</li>
<li>What is the morbidity or mortality rate associated with the agent?</li>
</ul>
<p>It may not be necessary to take the most conservative approach to samples of unknown infection status, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6396570/#B9">2012 Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories</a> provides a comprehensive guide to nuanced risk assessments in this scenario.</p>
<h2 id="regulations">Regulations</h2>
<p>Regulation of animal research differs by locations and sources of funding. Always check local policies and laws in detail prior to using animals.</p>
<h3 id="united-states">United States</h3>
<p>The USDA <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/AC_BlueBook_AWA_FINAL_2017_508comp.pdf">Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations</a> (AWRs) apply to all mammals, with the exception of lab mice and rats bred for the purpose of research. If using regulated animals, these activities are subject to review and approval by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). That IACUC reports to the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. As previously mentioned, many institutions include external members, such as lay people from the local community who undergo training, as part of their IACUC.</p>
<p>Those in receipt of <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/html5/section_4/4.1.1_animal_welfare_requirements.htm">federal funding from the U.S.</a> are required to follow additional policies and ensure their animal care programs cover &quot;any live, vertebrate animal used or intended for use in research, research training, experimentation, or biological testing or for related purposes.&quot; Consideration should be given to the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf">Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf">American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines on Euthanasia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK54048/">U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Use in Testing, Research and Training</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For privately funded science there is no additional oversight at a federal level, but you should check other federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies and consider voluntarily adhering to more stringent guidelines. Additional guidance and a voluntary accreditation program is available through the<a href="http://www.aaalac.org/">Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that the animal itself and the nature of the procedure might bring the work under other regulations (e.g., on imports of exotic species, use of infectious organisms, genetic modification, medical treatment).</p>
<h3 id="europe">Europe</h3>
<p>Work with animals is governed by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:276:0033:0079:en:PDF">Directive 2010/63/EU</a> revising <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12513679">Directive 86/609/EEC</a> on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm">protection of animals</a> used for scientific purposes. The Directive is firmly based on the principle of the Three Rs, to replace, reduce and refine the use of animals used for scientific purposes. The legislation covers non-human vertebrate species (including independently feeding larval forms and last trimester fetal forms of mammals) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod">cephalopods</a> used for the purposes of basic research, higher education, and training.</p>
<p>Article 3, Section 1 of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0063&amp;from=EN">Directive 2010/63/EU</a> defines a regulated &quot;procedure&quot; as:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>any use, invasive or non-invasive, of an animal for experimental or other scientific purposes, with known or unknown outcome, or educational purposes, which may cause the animal a level of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice. This includes any course of action intended, or liable, to result in the birth or hatching of an animal or the creation and maintenance of a genetically modified animal line in any such condition, but excludes the killing of animals solely for the use of their organs or tissues.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The legislation is driven by the Three R&#39;s so all use of animals in research must be justified, explaining why a non-animal could not be used instead.</p>
<p>Member States are required to ensure that each breeder, supplier and user sets up an animal-welfare body. The animal-welfare body for laboratory organizations should include at least the person or persons responsible for the welfare and care of the animals and a scientific member. The animal-welfare body must also receive input from a designated veterinarian or other suitably qualified expert, who can advise on the well-being and treatment of the animals.</p>
<p>Licensing is very stringent in many Member States. For example, in the UK, any researcher using vertebrates (including frogs and fish) must have three licenses from the Home Office:</p>
<ol>
<li>An establishment licence covering the organization</li>
<li>A project license for the research program</li>
<li>A personal license for all people using the animals</li>
</ol>
<p>The licenses are only authorized if there are no suitable alternatives that replace animal use, reduce the number of animals needed, or refine the procedures used to cause less suffering. Due to these stringent regulations, it is not recommended that community labs in Europe use vertebrate organisms.</p>
<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>Once a risk assessment has been completed and controls put in place, training should be offered to researchers working with the animals to ensure they are able to maintain and contain them appropriately with regard for lab hygiene and animal welfare and fulfil all of the regulations covering their work. People with no experience working with the organism should ideally collaborate with a more experienced member or an expert.</p>
<h2 id="hygiene">Hygiene</h2>
<p>A major concern for animal research is maintaining good hygiene to avoid contamination of the animal cultures and the lab environment. Good hygiene also reduces the risk of developing allergies or allergic reactions, which are often made worse by the accumulation of waste and detritus. Consider the following to improve hygiene when working with animals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sterile technique should be used when necessary (e.g., when subculturing nematode worms). Use similar techniques to good microbiological practice, such as the use of microbiological safety cabinets for preparing media or good aseptic technique and disposable or frequently sterilized equipment.</li>
<li>Use disposable culture vessels (e.g., tubes, plates, dishes) and frequently wash any reusable cages or tubes with disinfectant such as bleach. In some cases, culture vessels may be autoclavable.</li>
<li>Experimenters should be vigilant to avoid contamination which may include: feces, fungi and bacteria; mites and other arthropods; molds; and cross-contamination between cultures.</li>
<li>Destroy contaminated cultures through chemical disinfection or autoclaving as soon as they are identified. Notify other lab users in case the problem has already spread to other animal cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended to separate any new animal cultures coming into the lab and check for contamination before storing alongside existing ones. For example, <em>Drosophila</em> mites can be a major problem and are often carried between facilities by movement or sharing of contaminated cultures.</p>
<h2 id="allergies">Allergies</h2>
<p>Up to a <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/eh76.pdf">quarter of people</a> who regularly work with small mammals and insects develop an <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/eh76.pdf">allergic response</a>, usually as a result of <a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/documents/laapp.pdf">contact with proteins that animals</a> secrete in their waste or by shedding skin, fur, and scales. This typically causes minor but irritating symptoms such as an itchy nose or watering eyes, but asthma or serious anaphylactic shock can also occur. All persons working with lab animals should be considered at risk, even if allergy has never been a problem before.</p>
<p>Water-dwelling animals, such as Daphnia (water flea) or tardigrades and nematode worms, are not typically a high risk for allergies as the water or culture medium reduces airborne allergens.Insects, such as <em>Drosophila</em> and particularly butterflies and moths (whose wing scales have been shown to cause allergies), are higher risk. Mammalian species with dander or fur are also a much higher risk. We strongly discourage the use of mammals in community labs.</p>
<p>Most community labs do not have occupational health screening programs. However, if members are acting in formal roles such as lab manager or trainer and their work involves handling animals, the community lab may be legally required to provide screening to those employees. Always check local regulations for occupational health screening requirements. All members should be encouraged to self-report problems, and safety officers should proactively follow up at regular intervals and encourage members to seek advice from medical professionals if problems arise. Any issues will require a revision of the risk assessment and in some cases may mean the member discontinues work with the organism to which they develop an allergy.</p>
<p>There are several actions you can take to lower the risk of allergies arising and allergic reactions occuring:</p>
<p><strong>Handling and Husbandry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Handling of animals should be kept to a minimum and always performed in accordance with the risk assessment and standard operating procedure for the project.</li>
<li>Covered boxes, tubes, cages, or tanks should be used for housing animals and cleaned or replaced on a regular basis. Surfaces around animal work areas should also be frequently cleaned.</li>
<li>Use &quot;dust-free&quot; bedding or material (e.g., in rearing beetles, cockroaches, or other insects).</li>
<li>Preference water-dwelling animals which do not generate dust or aerosols.</li>
<li>Ensure good ventilation in rooms housing animals with low humidity and good air flow. If the animal requires high humidity, consider a cabinet rather than humidifying a room to minimize issues with mold.</li>
<li>Any waste should be promptly bagged and disposed of via the appropriate route.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wear gloves when handling or working with animals and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HeG0vtNfyyLkiiXLOywbcziDBv8g3J2bDdhwnjdlg2s/">dispose</a> of them after the task is completed to avoid spreading allergens around the lab.</li>
<li>Regularly wash hands and moisturize.</li>
<li>Wear a lab coat and launder it frequently. If an animal sheds allergens (e.g., moth scales or insects that form dry dust in their cages), consider a disposable lab coat that is only used for animal-related tasks.</li>
<li>If a respiratory allergy develops, a respirator mask may be required to continue working with the allergen. The use of a respirator must conform to local standards and be properly face-fitted to the person in order to be effective, and this may not be realistic to achieve in a community lab setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disposal-and-decontamination">Disposal and Decontamination</h2>
<p>Prior to obtaining animals, a plan must be in place for the end of the project and disposal, which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release:</strong> Always check local regulations as wildlife and public health officials may need to approve the capture and release of some animals from and to the wild. If the organism is non-native, GM, or infected, then this will not be a viable route of disposal.</li>
<li><strong>Euthanasia:</strong> For invertebrates, this typically involves freezing them, using carbon dioxide, or aneasthetising substances and then putting in ethanol or other disinfectant. If using vertebrates or other animals covered by regulations, when euthanasia is necessary it should be performed by a trained person and in accordance with the most recent recommendations. For example, in the U.S., the <a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Euthanasia-Guidelines.aspx">American Veterinary Medical Association</a> provides guidelines for vertebrates and there are separate guidelines for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354955">cephalopods in research</a>. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-the-housing-and-care-of-animals-bred-supplied-or-used-for-scientific-purposes">UK Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Purposes</a> also provide detailed advice on euthanasia.</li>
</ul>
<p>GM and potentially infected invertebrates should always be processed as biological waste, including chemical disinfection or autoclaving. Non-recombinant or wildtype invertebrates can typically be disposed of into the regular trash once they have been euthanized. However, all biological organisms used in the lab should be disposed of through the standard biological waste stream to avoid confusion.</p>
<h2 id="common-types-of-lab-animals">Common Types of Lab Animals</h2>
<h3 id="arthropods-eg-drosophila-melanogaster">Arthropods (e.g. <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>)</h3>
<p><strong>Containment</strong></p>
<p>Arthropod Containment Level 1 (ACL-1) is suitable for work with non-vector arthropods, uninfected arthropod vectors, or those infected with a nonpathogen. This would include native arthropods regardless of whether there is disease transmission in the area and exotic or alien arthropods that would be: (a) nonviable or (b) only capable of becoming temporarily established in an area with no active disease transmission. ACL-1 would include most uses of arthropods including arthropod vectors in community labs.</p>
<p><em>Location and Housing</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Arthropods should be located out of the flow of general traffic and ideally in environmental chambers or incubators.</li>
<li>The area around arthropod containers should be kept clean and free of clutter to easily allow identification, recapture, or killing of escaped individuals.</li>
<li>Cages and other culture containers should be cleaned regularly after being heated or chilled to a lethal temperature for any remaining arthropods or eggs.</li>
<li>Cages should be robust and prevent escape at all life stages (e.g., mesh screens should be durable and small enough to prevent even the smallest individuals from escaping). Use of bags and rearing trays to add additional leak prevention is encouraged. Vessels containing stages with limited mobility (e.g., eggs, pupae, hibernating adults) should be labeled and sufficient to prevent escape of a mobile form following development. Cages and containers can typically be manufactured easily from plastic bottles, disposal jars, and plastic food containers. Cheap sources of netting include garden netting and pairs of nylon tights.</li>
<li>Non-flying species can be contained by moats of water and housed in vials or other containers within a secondary storage container, such as a lidded plastic food container.</li>
<li>Consider a secondary containment zone (e.g., a netted door into the room containing the cages). If this is not possible and the risk of escape remains high, a &quot;cage within a cage&quot; strategy can be adopted.</li>
<li>All cages should be clearly labeled.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Escape and Entrance Procedure</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All life stages of arthropods must be killed before disposal. Arthropods may be killed with hot water, carbon dioxide, and ethanol, or freezing before being placed into trash bags.</li>
<li>Monitor escapees. An effective arthropod trapping program is recommended (e.g., DIY baited traps with fruit or sugar in a bottle of water with an inverted cone of paper that makes it easy for flies to enter but hard for them to navigate out). Standard commercial fly paper or electronic fly traps may also be used for small flying insects.</li>
<li>A program should be implemented to prevent the entrance of wild arthropods (e.g., houseflies, cockroaches, spiders) and rodents to avoid predation, contamination, and possible inadvertent infection.</li>
<li>Furniture and racks should be minimized and be easily moved to permit easy cleaning and location of escaped arthropods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arthropods known or suspected to be harboring BSL-2 level infectious agents will typically be treated as BSL-2. These infectious agents are not recommended for use in community labs due to the risk of disease infection and transmission.</p>

<li>Bites and stings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performing Procedures</strong></p>
<p>There is an ongoing debate about invertebrates&#39; abilities to perceive pain or otherwise experience compromised welfare. Before performing experimental procedures, arthropods can be anaesthetised by use of injected or inhaled anesthetics or by cooling them down in a refrigerator or on ice. There is a lack of data on dosage levels, timing, and efficacy of these methods across different species. However, carbon dioxide or triethylamine-based anesthetics like FlyNap are very commonly used with <em>Drosophila</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Euthanasia and Disposal</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf">AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition</a> (pg. 75) states for captive invertebrates, &quot;while there is ongoing debate about invertebrates&#39; abilities to perceive pain or otherwise experience compromised welfare, the Guidelines assume that a conservative and humane approach to the care of any creature is warranted and expected by society. Consequently, euthanasia methods should be used that minimize the potential for pain or distress. Most commonly used methods involve terminal anesthesia, followed by physical removal of the nervous system, to assure lack of sensory perception and death of the animal.&quot;</p>
<p>Acceptable methods for captive invertebrates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Injectable euthanasia by potassium chloride or pentobarbital.</li>
<li>Inhaled anesthetics followed by physical or chemical methods (e.g., submersion in ethanol or freezing).</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide (no efficacy data for some species) followed by physical or chemical methods (e.g., submersion in ethanol or freezing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Euthanized arthropods can then go through the standard biological waste stream so long as they are filtered from flammable and toxic liquids before autoclaving. It is common in fly work to collect anesthetized flies in a bottle filled with ethanol (a &quot;fly morgue&quot; or &quot;kill jar&quot;). If this method is used then the container should be leak-proof, wide mouthed (or paired with a funnel), sealable, made of ethanol-rated plastic, and clearly labelled. Dispose of the whole bottle via the chemical waste stream or filter out the flies and reuse the ethanol because flammable substances cannot be autoclaved. Ensure that funnels, surfaces, tubes, and cages are all frozen then rinsed in ethanol or disinfectant to avoid carryover of eggs and larvae.</p>
<h3 id="c-elegans-tardigrades-and-other-water-dwelling-invertebrates"><em>C. elegans</em>, Tardigrades, and Other Water-Dwelling Invertebrates</h3>
<p><strong>Containment</strong></p>
<p>Water-dwelling invertebrates do not have a specific set of containment guidelines from an internationally recognized agency, but the principles laid out earlier in this chapter apply. They are easier to contain than organisms that walk or fly. Tanks and containers can be made very easily from standard lab plasticware and food containers. If tanks are connected to a main water supply, meshes should be used to ensure organisms cannot escape. Cleaning procedures should be carefully designed to minimize the risk of live animals being washed into drains connected to main water supplies. Aquatic animals, including viable fertilized eggs, should be kept in appropriate tanks fitted with filters that are sufficient to retain the smallest organism or eggs likely to be present.</p>
<p>Be aware that animals such as tardigrades and rotifers that are desiccation resistant are very difficult to contain in their dried-out state as they are extremely light and movable by air currents.</p>
<p><strong>Major Safety Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>None additional to considerations pertaining to all animals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Euthanasia and Disposal</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf">AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition</a> recommends a two-stage strategy for euthanizing aquatic invertebratesâ€”with chemical injection of anesthesia, followed by a method that destroys the brain or major ganglia physically (e.g., pithing, freezing, boiling) or chemically (e.g., alcohol, formalin). There are major differences across the phyla; check the literature for each species.</p>
<p><strong>First Step</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium salts (note: ineffective for crustaceans). Different phyla require a different concentration so check the literature.</li>
<li>Clove oilâ€”this has been used effectively as an immersion agent for the euthanasia of crustaceans at 0.125 mL/L.</li>
<li>Ethanolâ€”this has been used for euthanasia of some phyla at a 1% to 5% concentration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second Step</strong></p>
<h2 id="-pithing-ie-piercing-or-severing-the-spinal-cordrequires-detailed-anatomic-knowledge-of-the-species">- Pithing (i.e. piercing or severing the spinal cord)â€”requires detailed anatomic knowledge of the species.</h2>

<p>Euthanized invertebrates can go through the standard biological waste stream so long as they are filtered from any flammable liquids before autoclaving.</p>
<h3 id="cephalopods">Cephalopods</h3>
<p><strong>Containment</strong></p>
<p>Cephalopods can be treated similarly to aquatic invertebrates although they will need more rearing space and equipment (e.g., properly aerated tanks and enriched environments). Methods of containment and euthanasia are identical to acqautic invertebrates although we do not recommend using them for invasive procedures, particularly in regions where they fall under regulations on animals in research. There is likely to be a significant regulatory and administrative burden for a community lab in these areas. And in all cases, cephalopods require a significant investment in care and husbandry.</p>

<p><strong>Euthanasia and Disposal</strong></p>
<p>Euthanasia and disposal recommendations are identical to aquatic invertebrates. Check specific guidance from <a href="https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Documents/euthanasia.pdf">AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition</a> or equivalent local guidelines.</p>
<p>More information on use of cephalopods in research can be found in Fiorito, Graziano, et al., &quot;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26354955">Guidelines for the Care and Welfare of Cephalopods in Researchâ€“A consensus based on an initiative by CephRes, FELASA and the Boyd Group</a>.&quot; Laboratory animals 49.2_suppl (2015): 1-90.</p>
<h3 id="fish-and-amphibians">Fish and Amphibians</h3>
<p>There are instances of projects using fish (e.g., <em>Danio rerio</em> or zebrafish) and amphibians (e.g., <em>Xenopus laevis</em> or frogs). Notably, a frog gene therapy kit is provided by one biology kit <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-01-gene-editing-kit-power-frog-growth.html">company</a> in the U.S. Its use is acceptable under existing U.S. guidelines but would not be possible in Europe outside of a lab that has met the regulatory requirements for work with vertebrate animals. Always check local legislation and regulation before embarking on any research involving vertebrates. Fish, reptiles, and amphibians may also require <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSj94EPm5sRLWfVANHygogkd-lxe4FesQSHX9I50tWI/edit#">permits</a> to import and keep in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>Containment</strong></p>
<p>There are specific guidelines for the care and housing of fish and amphibians, including housing, food, light, temperature, humidity, food, and enrichment in the<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388535/CoPanimalsWeb.pdf">UK Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for Scientific Purposes</a> and the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/guide-for-the-care-and-use-of-laboratory-animals.pdf">Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</a> published by the National Academies Press.
